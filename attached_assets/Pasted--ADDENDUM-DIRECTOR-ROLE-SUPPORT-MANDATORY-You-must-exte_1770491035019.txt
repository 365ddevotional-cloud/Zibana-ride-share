🔔 ADDENDUM — DIRECTOR ROLE SUPPORT (MANDATORY)

You must extend ZIBRA (ZIBA Support / Z-Assist) to fully support the DIRECTOR role.

DEFINITION:
Director = Organizational / corporate account role that can:
- Book rides for multiple riders
- Manage schedules
- View trip summaries
- Handle billing oversight (NO commission visibility)
- Coordinate with Admin but is NOT Admin

====================================================
PHASE D-PLUS — DIRECTOR-AWARE ZIBRA SUPPORT
====================================================

1) ROLE DETECTION
- Detect role = Director via backend auth token
- Never rely on frontend role flags
- Director role sits BETWEEN Driver and Admin in privileges

====================================================
2) DIRECTOR MODE CAPABILITIES
====================================================

When role = Director, ZIBRA Support must:

✔ Explain Director dashboard sections
✔ Guide bulk / scheduled ride booking
✔ Explain rider assignment flows
✔ Explain trip status & summaries
✔ Guide wallet funding & invoicing (high-level only)
✔ Explain cancellation rules for corporate rides
✔ Assist with lost-item coordination for assigned riders
✔ Explain notifications and inbox messages
✔ Assist with approval status (read-only)

RESTRICTIONS:
- No system configuration
- No user approval actions
- No access to admin logs
- No access to trust score internals
- No visibility into commissions or platform fees
- No access to other organizations’ data

====================================================
3) ROLE-BASED RESPONSE VARIATION
====================================================

The SAME question must yield DIFFERENT answers:

Example:
Question: “Why was this ride canceled?”

- Rider → personal impact explanation
- Driver → operational explanation
- Director → organizational / scheduling explanation
- Admin → policy + resolution tools
- Super Admin → system + risk context

====================================================
4) DIRECTOR LEGAL LANGUAGE
====================================================

ZIBRA responses for Directors must use:
- “ZIBA facilitates coordination for your organization…”
- “Based on your organization’s booking…”
- “We recommend reviewing scheduled ride settings…”

NEVER SAY:
- “ZIBA guarantees service availability”
- “ZIBA is responsible for organizational losses”
- “ZIBA controls driver behavior”

====================================================
5) DIRECTOR UI ENTRY POINTS
====================================================

Add ZIBRA Support access to:
- Director Dashboard sidebar
- Director Help / Support page
- Director Inbox

Director Inbox supports:
- Trip updates
- Scheduling confirmations
- Cancellation notices
- Billing alerts
- Safety & lost-item updates

Unread badge rules apply (red badge + count).

====================================================
6) DIRECTOR ANALYTICS (ADMIN VIEW ONLY)
====================================================

Admins & Super Admins may view:
- Director ZIBRA usage volume
- Top Director issues
- Escalation rates
- Abuse flags (if any)

Directors NEVER see analytics.

====================================================
7) FINAL VALIDATION — DIRECTOR ROLE
====================================================

Confirm:
✔ Director role detected correctly
✔ Director-only responses enforced
✔ No admin or super-admin data leakage
✔ No commission visibility
✔ Inbox + notifications work
✔ Escalations route properly

Do NOT mark implementation complete until Director role passes end-to-end testing.
