You are implementing the DIRECTOR MODULE across the ZIBA platform.

This includes:
- Contract Directors
- Employee Directors

This module must be isolated, auditable, role-safe, commission-aware, and ZIBRA-assisted.

DO NOT break existing admin, driver, or rider flows.
DO NOT expose platform commission math publicly.
DO NOT allow Directors to override Admin or Super Admin authority.

=====================================================
PHASE 1 — DIRECTOR TYPES & RULES (FOUNDATION)
=====================================================

1) DIRECTOR TYPES
A) Contract Director
- Activated only after recruiting minimum 10 drivers
- Uses referral code to onboard drivers
- Drivers recruited are auto-assigned to director cell
- Commission applies ONLY to:
  - what ZIBA earns from drivers
  - capped commissionable drivers
  - daily active drivers (77% rule)
- Has lifespan set by Admin / Super Admin
- May manage up to 3 driver cells
- Max drivers per cell: 1300
- Max commissionable active drivers per day: 1000
- Commission percentage (default 12%) is configurable by Super Admin

B) Employee Director
- Drivers assigned automatically by ZIBA
- No referral code required
- Performance-based continuation
- Subject to suspension/termination by Admin / Super Admin

=====================================================
PHASE 2 — COMMISSION & CAPS LOGIC (SERVER SIDE)
=====================================================

2) COMMISSION LOGIC (STRICT)
For Contract Directors:
- Only earn commission on what ZIBA earns
- Daily commissionable drivers = 77% of active drivers that day
- Apply hard caps:
  - max active drivers/day = 1300
  - max commissionable drivers/day = 1000
- Excess drivers generate NO commission
- Commission % adjustable by Super Admin
- All calculations server-side only
- Director never sees raw platform commission numbers

=====================================================
PHASE 3 — DIRECTOR DASHBOARD (PRIVATE)
=====================================================

3) DASHBOARD VISIBILITY
- Visible ONLY to:
  - Director
  - Admin
  - Super Admin
- Each action logged with:
  - who performed it
  - timestamp
  - role
  - IP/session

4) DASHBOARD SECTIONS
Director Dashboard must include:

A) Overview
- Active drivers count
- Commission-eligible drivers today
- Earnings summary (abstracted)
- Trust/Performance score

B) Driver Management
- View drivers under director
- Activate drivers signed via referral
- Discipline drivers:
  - warnings
  - temporary suspension
- Cannot deactivate permanently (Admin/Super Admin only)

C) Staff Management (Director Team)
- Director can hire staff
- Assign staff roles:
  - operations
  - recruitment
  - compliance
- Each staff sees ONLY their permitted sections
- Director can discipline staff (with Admin permission)

D) Reports & Performance
- Driver activity trends
- Compliance flags
- ZIBRA performance suggestions

=====================================================
PHASE 4 — ZIBRA FOR DIRECTORS (PRIVATE MODE)
=====================================================

5) ZIBRA ROLE
ZIBRA must assist Directors by:
- Explaining commission rules (high-level)
- Highlighting performance gaps
- Suggesting driver engagement actions
- Warning when caps or lifespan limits are near
- Never exposing raw platform financials

If asked “why is my commission low?”
ZIBRA response style:
- neutral
- data-informed
- no blame
- no guarantees

=====================================================
PHASE 5 — DIRECTOR APPOINTMENTS (SUPER ADMIN)
=====================================================

6) DIRECTOR APPOINTMENT PANEL
Add Super Admin-only section:
- Appoint Contract Director
- Appoint Employee Director
- Set:
  - lifespan
  - max cells
  - commission %
  - permissions
- Suspend / terminate directors
- View director history & audit trail

=====================================================
PHASE 6 — SAFETY, LEGAL & AUDIT
=====================================================

7) LEGAL POSITIONING
- Directors are NOT employees unless explicitly marked
- ZIBA facilitates commission tracking only
- No guaranteed income
- Performance-based continuation
- Terms accepted at Director onboarding

8) AUDIT REQUIREMENTS
- Every action logged
- No silent edits
- Admin & Super Admin see full history
- Directors see only their own activity

=====================================================
PHASE 7 — QA CHECKLIST
=====================================================

Confirm:
✔ Director cannot exceed caps
✔ Director cannot see platform internals
✔ Admin/Super Admin override intact
✔ Staff permissions isolated
✔ ZIBRA guidance accurate
✔ No existing flows broken

=====================================================
DELIVERABLES
=====================================================

Provide:
1) Director Dashboard routes
2) Permission matrix
3) Commission calculation rules
4) ZIBRA response patterns for Directors
5) Admin appointment screens

Proceed step-by-step.
Confirm after each phase.
