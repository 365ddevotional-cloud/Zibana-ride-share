PROJECT: ZIBA Ride-Hailing Platform
SCOPE: Rider Hub + Driver Hub UX, Payments, Notifications, Inbox, Settings, Activities

GOAL:
Upgrade ZIBA Rider and Driver apps to be production-ready, visually premium, reliable, and engagement-driven — inspired by Uber but not copied.

------------------------------------
A. GLOBAL UI / UX FIXES (RIDER + DRIVER)
------------------------------------
1. Fix ALL crash routes:
   - Inbox page currently throws “Something went wrong”.
   - Add proper API guards, empty-state UI, and fallback rendering.
   - No route should ever crash the app.

2. Typography & Visual Consistency:
   - Apply the SAME large, elegant typography used on the ZIBA Welcome page across:
     • Rider Home
     • Driver Home
     • Account
     • Settings
     • Inbox
   - Increase heading sizes, spacing, and font weight for premium feel.
   - Ensure consistent spacing, rounded cards, and soft shadows.

3. Appearance Toggle Everywhere:
   - Add Light / Dark / System (Auto) mode selector.
   - Must exist on:
     • Welcome page
     • Rider account
     • Driver account
     • Settings page
   - Persist user choice in database.
   - Default = System (Auto).

------------------------------------
B. NAVIGATION STRUCTURE (RIDER)
------------------------------------
Bottom Navigation Tabs:
- Home
- Services (Scheduled / Corporate / Special rides)
- Activity (Trips history, cancellations, penalties)
- Inbox (Messages & notifications)
- Account (Profile & Settings)

------------------------------------
C. INBOX & NOTIFICATIONS SYSTEM (CORE FEATURE)
------------------------------------
1. Inbox System:
   - Create a fully functional Inbox page.
   - Show message list with:
     • Title
     • Preview text
     • Timestamp
     • Read / Unread state
   - Add unread message badge:
     • Red circle on Inbox icon
     • White bold number inside

2. Default Welcome Message:
   On signup, auto-insert message:
   Title: “Welcome to ZIBA 🎉”
   Body: 
   “We’re excited to have you on ZIBA. Enjoy safe, reliable rides and exclusive benefits designed just for you.”

3. Notification Engine:
   - Notifications ON by default.
   - User may opt-out in Settings.
   - Notifications must:
     • Appear in-app
     • Appear as system push notifications (SMS-like behavior)
   - Use push + in-app sync.

4. Notification Types:
   - Ride status
   - Driver assigned
   - Cancellation penalties
   - Wallet low balance
   - Promotions & loyalty rewards
   - Safety alerts

------------------------------------
D. SETTINGS & ACCOUNT (RIDER)
------------------------------------
Create a structured Settings area inspired by Uber but original:

Sections:
1. Account
   - Profile
   - Phone
   - Email
   - Verification status

2. Communication
   - Push notifications (ON by default)
   - Marketing messages (ON by default)
   - Ride alerts
   - Safety alerts (cannot be disabled)

3. Appearance
   - Light / Dark / System

4. Privacy & Data
   - Data usage summary
   - Ride history controls

5. Accessibility
   - Larger text toggle
   - High contrast mode

6. Safety
   - Trusted contacts
   - Ride PIN
   - Emergency button

------------------------------------
E. PAYMENTS & WALLET STRATEGY
------------------------------------
1. Payment Rule (Phase 1):
   - Cash and Card both allowed
   - ALL rides must be FUNDED THROUGH WALLET
   - Card = auto-fund wallet
   - Cash = driver receives cash, platform still records wallet equivalent

2. Wallet Funding Methods:
   - Card
   - Bank transfer
   - Admin credit (support tool)

3. Auto Top-Up:
   - Optional setting
   - Trigger when balance drops below threshold

------------------------------------
F. CANCELLATION FEES & PENALTIES
------------------------------------
Design exact logic:

Rider cancels:
- Before driver assigned → Free
- After driver assigned → Small fee
- Driver arrived → Full cancellation fee

Driver cancels:
- Repeated cancellations reduce driver rating
- Temporary job priority reduction

Scheduled Ride Penalties:
- Cancel < X hours → penalty
- No-show → full charge

------------------------------------
G. SCHEDULED & CORPORATE RIDES
------------------------------------
1. Fix Scheduled Ride button (currently disabled):
   - Ensure validation logic
   - Enable backend route
   - Add success confirmation UI

2. Corporate / Organization Rides:
   - Corporate account dashboard
   - Monthly invoicing
   - Ride limits per member
   - Admin approvals

------------------------------------
H. ACTIVITIES TAB
------------------------------------
Activities should show:
- Completed rides
- Cancelled rides
- Penalties applied
- Wallet deductions
- Rewards earned

------------------------------------
I. STRATEGIC IN-APP MARKETING (AUTOMATED)
------------------------------------
Add smart, respectful engagement messages:
- “You’re close to a loyalty reward 🎁”
- “Schedule rides and save time”
- “Wallet low — top up now”

No spam.
Triggered by behavior.

------------------------------------
J. DRIVER HUB (PARITY + EXTRAS)
------------------------------------
Driver app must include:
- Inbox + notifications (same system)
- Appearance toggle
- Earnings activity
- Wallet & payouts
- Penalty explanations
- Driver-only promotions
- Driver safety hub

------------------------------------
K. ZIBA-ONLY IMPROVEMENTS (NOT IN UBER)
------------------------------------
Add unique features:
1. Ride Trust Score (visible, transparent)
2. Loyalty wallet cashback
3. Community announcements from ZIBA
4. Driver appreciation messages
5. Local event ride boosts

------------------------------------
DELIVERABLE:
Implement all above cleanly, modularly, and production-safe.
No placeholders. No broken routes. No silent failures.
