This is a critical system-level failure blocking the ZIBA project and must be fixed decisively.

Here is the situation, based strictly on live behavior and screenshots:

1) TEST CREDITS INFLATION BUG (ADMIN SIDE)
When a Rider Tester is added, the system is supposed to assign ₦45,000 test credits.
Instead, the Admin → Tester Management screen is displaying massively inflated values (e.g. ₦4,500,000 or ₦13,530,000).
This inflation does NOT match the actual rider wallet balance.
This is incorrect and must be fixed at the source.

2) RIDER WALLET IS CORRECT BUT IGNORED
On the Rider Wallet page:
- Test Wallet shows ₦45,000 or ₦90,000 correctly
- Main Wallet shows ₦0.00 (expected for testers)
So the test wallet balance itself is correct.

However, when the rider clicks “Request Ride”, the backend responds:
INSUFFICIENT_BALANCE

This means the ride-booking logic is NOT using the test wallet at all.

3) WRONG WALLET USED FOR RIDE BOOKING
The system is clearly validating ride payments against the MAIN WALLET,
even when:
- The user is a tester
- Test Wallet is active
- Test credits exist

This is the core functional failure.

4) TEST MODE UI IS MISLEADING OR NON-FUNCTIONAL
There is a “Test Mode” indicator at the top right of the Wallet page.
It looks interactive but is NOT clickable and has no observable effect.
If Test Mode is supposed to control which wallet is used, it is either:
- Not wired to logic, OR
- Purely visual, OR
- Broken

This ambiguity must be resolved at the system level.

5) SUPER ADMIN CANNOT TOP UP MAIN WALLET
There is currently no reliable way for Super Admin to top up a user’s MAIN wallet.
This makes it impossible to bypass the issue or verify wallet selection behavior.

6) EXPECTED SYSTEM BEHAVIOR (HIGH LEVEL)
- Tester rides MUST be payable using Test Wallet by default
- Main Wallet should NEVER be required for testers
- Wallet selection must be deterministic and enforced server-side
- If wallet selection logic does not exist, the system must define one internally
- Test Mode must not rely on UI clicks to function correctly

IMPORTANT CONSTRAINTS:
- Do NOT return code
- Do NOT explain how you fixed it
- Do NOT provide testing instructions
- Do NOT ask the user to try anything

JUST FIX THE SYSTEM SO THAT:
- Test credits are displayed correctly
- Test credits are actually used for ride booking
- INS UFFICIENT_BALANCE no longer occurs when valid test credits exist
- Wallet selection logic is unambiguous and enforced

This issue is blocking the entire project and must be resolved decisively.
