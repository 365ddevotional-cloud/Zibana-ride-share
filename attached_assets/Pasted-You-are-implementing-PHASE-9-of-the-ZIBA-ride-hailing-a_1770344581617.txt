You are implementing PHASE 9 of the ZIBA ride-hailing app: DRIVER ACQUISITION AUTOMATION.

This phase automates how ZIBA attracts, onboards, activates, and retains drivers
at scale across multiple countries, states, and zones.

NO MANUAL DRIVER GROWTH.
NO PAY-FOR-SIGNUP WITHOUT ACTIVITY.

=====================================
1) DRIVER ACQUISITION CHANNELS
=====================================

Implement automated acquisition channels:

• Referral-based onboarding
• Fleet owner onboarding
• Public signup funnel
• Admin-invited drivers (controlled)

Each channel must be trackable and auditable.

=====================================
2) DRIVER REFERRAL SYSTEM (PRIMARY ENGINE)
=====================================

Referral rules:
• Each driver gets a unique referral code/link
• Referral reward triggers ONLY after:
  - New driver completes X trips
  - Within Y days
  - With acceptable cancellation & rating

Anti-fraud rules:
• No self-referral
• No repeated same-rider loops
• GPS-verified trips only
• One payout per referred driver

=====================================
3) FLEET OWNER AUTOMATION
=====================================

Implement Fleet Owner role:

• Fleet owners can:
  - Invite multiple drivers
  - Track activation status
  - Earn fleet bonuses (configurable)

Rules:
• Fleet bonuses trigger only on driver activation
• Fleet owners cannot manipulate trip outcomes
• Admin can suspend fleet access if abuse detected

=====================================
4) SMART DRIVER ONBOARDING FLOW
=====================================

Driver onboarding must be staged:

Stage 1: Signup
Stage 2: Document upload
Stage 3: Review & approval
Stage 4: First trip activation
Stage 5: Active driver

Rules:
• Drivers cannot go online before approval
• Incomplete onboarding must be resumable
• Admin approval time must be tracked

=====================================
5) DRIVER SUPPLY TARGETING (AUTOMATED)
=====================================

System must automatically detect low-supply zones:

• Monitor:
  - Online drivers
  - Pickup times
  - Failed requests

Rules:
• When supply drops:
  - Trigger referral boosts
  - Enable targeted bonuses
  - Notify nearby inactive drivers

=====================================
6) INCENTIVE AUTOMATION (REUSES PHASE 5)
=====================================

• Incentives must activate automatically when conditions are met
• Incentives must expire automatically
• Incentives must pause if abuse detected
• Admin can override incentives (Phase 3 rules)

=====================================
7) DRIVER COMMUNICATION AUTOMATION
=====================================

Automated messaging:
• Welcome messages
• Activation reminders
• Incentive progress updates
• Supply shortage alerts

Rules:
• Messages must be helpful, not spammy
• Messaging must be role-aware and zone-aware

=====================================
8) DRIVER ACQUISITION ANALYTICS
=====================================

Track:
• Cost per activated driver
• Time to first trip
• Referral conversion rate
• Fleet owner effectiveness
• Driver retention (D7, D30)

=====================================
9) FAIL-SAFE & CONTROL
=====================================

• Admin can pause driver acquisition per zone
• Kill-switches override onboarding & incentives
• No automation may bypass safety checks

=====================================
10) PHASE COMPLETION CRITERIA
=====================================

Phase 9 is complete only when:
• Drivers can be acquired without manual work
• Fraud is minimized
• Supply responds automatically to demand
• Admin remains fully in control

This phase must be completed before aggressive rider marketing.
