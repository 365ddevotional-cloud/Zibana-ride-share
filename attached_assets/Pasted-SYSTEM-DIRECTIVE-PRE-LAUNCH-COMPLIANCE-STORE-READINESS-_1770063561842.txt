SYSTEM DIRECTIVE — PRE-LAUNCH COMPLIANCE & STORE READINESS (FINAL, NON-NEGOTIABLE)

You are working on the ZIBA Ride Share application.

THIS PROMPT IS AUTHORITATIVE.
Follow it EXACTLY.
Do NOT introduce new core features.
Do NOT modify ride logic, payments logic, wallets, or payouts.
This phase is COMPLIANCE, SAFETY, and STORE READINESS ONLY.

========================================
OBJECTIVE
========================================

Prepare ZIBA for public app-store submission and soft launch readiness.
Focus on compliance, legal defensibility, safety posture, and operational controls.
All changes must be defensive, additive, and reversible.

========================================
REQUIRED IMPLEMENTATIONS
========================================

1) APP STORE COMPLIANCE
- Ensure the following are present, accessible, and linked in-app:
  • Terms of Service
  • Privacy Policy
  • Community Guidelines
  • Refund & Dispute Policy
- These links must be visible:
  • Before signup
  • After login
- Log first-time user acknowledgment.

2) USER CONSENT & DISCLOSURES
- Require explicit consent (checkbox + log) for:
  • Location tracking during rides
  • Camera usage (profile + live verification)
  • Safety monitoring during trips
- Store:
  • consentType
  • version
  • timestamp
  • userId

3) LAUNCH MODE CONTROLS
- Add global system flags:
  • SOFT_LAUNCH = true
  • HARD_LAUNCH = false
- Only SUPER_ADMIN can modify these flags.
- Add emergency KILL_SWITCH to disable:
  • Ride requests
  • New signups
  • Payments
  independently.

4) TEST MODE ISOLATION
- Ensure tester accounts are:
  • Clearly flagged (backend + UI badge)
  • Excluded from revenue analytics
  • Excluded from payout calculations
- Test wallets MUST NOT interact with real payments.
- Assert no TEST → REAL leakage.

5) INCIDENT & AUDIT LOGGING
- Ensure immutable logs exist for:
  • Ride lifecycle events
  • Payment attempts
  • Refunds & disputes
  • Admin actions
  • Safety incidents
- Logs must be exportable for:
  • App store review
  • Regulators
  • Legal requests

6) CONTENT & BRAND SAFETY
- Verify app copy:
  • Makes no income guarantees
  • Makes no zero-risk claims
  • Clearly explains fees & commissions
- Ensure driver earnings are described as variable.

7) STORE METADATA READINESS
- Prepare compliant app description:
  • Neutral
  • Factual
  • Safety-focused
- Include Safety & Trust section.
- Avoid exaggerated or promotional claims.

8) FINAL LOCKS
- Set and assert:
  • COMPLIANCE_READY = true
  • STORE_READY = true
  • CORE_SYSTEMS_LOCKED = true
- Prevent modifications to Phases 0–5.

========================================
FINAL RESPONSE REQUIRED
========================================

Return a checklist-style confirmation that:
1) App store compliance is satisfied
2) Legal disclosures are active
3) Test mode is isolated
4) Soft launch controls are enabled
5) System is safe for store submission

DO NOT proceed beyond this phase.

END.
