You are updating the ZIBA Rider App.  

GOAL:
Restore and activate ride classification selection in the “Request a Ride” flow using ORIGINAL ZIBA ride classes (not Uber-branded), ensure pricing tiers are different, and make all related UI elements clickable and functional.

CRITICAL RULES:
- Audit existing code first.
- If a feature already exists, UPDATE it.
- If missing, IMPLEMENT it.
- Do NOT break existing booking, pricing, or driver-matching logic.
- Do NOT reference Uber or Lyft anywhere in code or UI.
- Keep naming 100% ZIBA-original.

================================================
PHASE 1 — AUDIT FIRST (MANDATORY)
================================================
1) Search for existing ride class logic:
   - rideType, serviceType, vehicleClass, tripClass, fareClass
   - UI components in Request Ride, Services, Preferences
2) Check if ride class filtering was removed or hidden.
3) Identify why ride class selector is no longer visible in the Request Ride flow.
4) Re-enable or reinsert the selector where it was originally intended.

================================================
PHASE 2 — DEFINE ZIBA ORIGINAL RIDE CLASSES
================================================
Create or update the following DEFAULT ZIBA ride classes:

1) ZIBA Go
   - Cheapest option
   - 4 seats
   - Everyday rides
   - Base fare multiplier: 1.0x

2) ZIBA Plus
   - Larger vehicles (6–7 seats)
   - Fare multiplier: 1.3x

3) ZIBA Comfort
   - Newer vehicles, smoother experience
   - Fare multiplier: 1.5x

4) ZIBA PetRide
   - Pet-friendly vehicles only
   - Fare multiplier: 1.5x

5) ZIBA SafeTeen
   - Teen/youth rides
   - Extra safety rules
   - Fare multiplier: 1.4x

6) ZIBA Elite
   - Premium vehicles and top-rated drivers
   - Fare multiplier: 2.0x or higher

Store these in a configurable table/model so Super Admin can adjust pricing per country/city.

================================================
PHASE 3 — REQUEST RIDE UI (RIDER)
================================================
On the “Request a Ride” screen:
- Display ride class selector cards/buttons:
  [ ZIBA Go | ZIBA Plus | ZIBA Comfort | ZIBA PetRide | ZIBA SafeTeen | ZIBA Elite ]
- Each class must show:
  - Estimated fare
  - ETA
  - Short description
- Selecting a class updates fare calculation in real time.
- Default selection = ZIBA Go.

Ensure this works for:
- Immediate rides
- Scheduled rides
- Corporate rides (if enabled for the user)

================================================
PHASE 4 — SERVICES PAGE FIX
================================================
On the Rider “Services” tab:
- Remove “Coming Soon” from:
  - Corporate Rides
  - Special Rides
- Make BOTH boxes clickable.
- Corporate Rides → route to Corporate Rides onboarding/info page.
- Special Rides → route to ride class explanation page (ZIBA Go → Elite).

If pages do not exist, create minimal functional pages (info + CTA).

================================================
PHASE 5 — DRIVER ELIGIBILITY LOGIC
================================================
Update driver matching rules:
- Drivers can be eligible for multiple ZIBA ride classes.
- Eligibility depends on:
  - Vehicle type
  - Driver rating
  - Admin/Director approval
- ZIBA Elite and SafeTeen require extra approval flags.

================================================
PHASE 6 — ADMIN & DIRECTOR CONTROLS
================================================
Admin / Super Admin:
- Enable/disable ride classes per city/country.
- Adjust fare multipliers.
- Set eligibility rules.

Directors:
- View which drivers qualify for which ride classes.
- Cannot change pricing.
- Can recommend drivers for higher classes (approval required).

================================================
PHASE 7 — ZIBRA (ZIBA SUPPORT) RESPONSES
================================================
Add response templates for:
- “What is ZIBA Go?”
- “Why is ZIBA Elite more expensive?”
- “How do I choose the best ride class?”
- “Why can’t I see some ride options?”

Language rules:
- Advisory only
- No guarantees
- No liability admission

================================================
PHASE 8 — FINAL CHECKS
================================================
- All ride class boxes must be clickable.
- Ride class selection must affect pricing.
- No “Coming Soon” labels remain.
- UI must match existing ZIBA theme.
- Log changes clearly.

CONFIRMATION REQUIRED:
After implementation, report:
- What files/routes were updated
- How to test ride class selection end-to-end
- Any remaining limitations
