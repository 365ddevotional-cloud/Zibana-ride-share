You are implementing PHASE 8 of the ZIBA ride-hailing app: MULTI-COUNTRY ROLLOUT PLAYBOOK.

This phase defines a repeatable, safe, step-by-step process to launch ZIBA
in any new country using the existing global launch controls, pricing, and kill-switches.

NO COUNTRY MAY LAUNCH WITHOUT PASSING ALL GATES.

=====================================
1) COUNTRY ROLLOUT STATES (LIFECYCLE)
=====================================

Define rollout_status per country:

- PLANNED
- PREP
- PILOT
- LIMITED_LIVE
- FULL_LIVE
- PAUSED

Rules:
• Country_enabled can only be true in PILOT or later
• Rollout_status controls feature exposure and limits

=====================================
2) PREP STAGE CHECKLIST (REQUIRED)
=====================================

Before moving a country to PILOT, verify:

• Country config exists (Phase 6B)
• Currency defined
• Default pricing set (Phase 7)
• At least one SubRegion configured
• Kill-switches verified
• Admin access confirmed

System must BLOCK rollout if any item is missing.

=====================================
3) PILOT LAUNCH RULES
=====================================

PILOT scope:
• 1–2 SubRegions only
• Hard caps on:
  - max daily trips
  - max concurrent drivers
• Surge disabled by default
• Incentives limited to activation only

Rules:
• Real users only (no test bypass)
• Pilot metrics must be collected

=====================================
4) PILOT SUCCESS METRICS (GATES)
=====================================

Country may move from PILOT → LIMITED_LIVE only if:

• Avg pickup time ≤ configured limit
• Trip completion rate ≥ threshold
• Cancellation rates within limits
• No critical incidents in last 7 days

If metrics fail → auto PAUSE country.

=====================================
5) LIMITED_LIVE RULES
=====================================

LIMITED_LIVE scope:
• More SubRegions allowed
• Surge allowed (capped)
• Incentives expanded cautiously
• Marketing allowed (controlled)

Rules:
• Daily monitoring required
• Kill-switches remain armed

=====================================
6) FULL_LIVE PROMOTION
=====================================

Country may move to FULL_LIVE only if:

• D7 retention acceptable
• Driver supply stable
• Support ticket volume manageable
• No emergency kill-switch use in last 14 days

FULL_LIVE unlocks:
• Full incentives
• Normal surge rules
• Wider marketing

=====================================
7) AUTOMATIC PAUSE & ROLLBACK
=====================================

System must auto-PAUSE a country if:

• Emergency mode triggered
• Payment failures spike
• Safety incidents detected
• Avg wait time exceeds hard cap

Rollback behavior:
• New trips blocked
• Existing trips complete safely
• Admin alerted immediately

=====================================
8) COUNTRY-SPECIFIC OVERRIDES
=====================================

Allow per-country overrides for:
• Incentive caps
• Commission ranges
• Vehicle availability
• Surge limits

Rules:
• Overrides must be logged
• Overrides must not break global safety rules

=====================================
9) ADMIN ROLLOUT DASHBOARD
=====================================

Admin must see, per country:
• Rollout status
• Active SubRegions
• Live drivers count
• Avg pickup time
• Active kill-switches
• Last incident timestamp

=====================================
10) ADDING A NEW COUNTRY (NO CODE)
=====================================

To add a new country:
• Create country record
• Define SubRegions
• Set pricing defaults
• Verify kill-switches
• Move to PREP

No redeploy required.

=====================================
11) PHASE COMPLETION CRITERIA
=====================================

Phase 8 is complete only when:
• Countries can be launched sequentially
• Bad launches auto-pause safely
• Admin can promote or rollback countries
• Global expansion requires configuration, not code

This phase enables ZIBA to scale internationally with control and confidence.
