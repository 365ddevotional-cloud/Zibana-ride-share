You are continuing execution of the ZIBA platform with FINALIZED Director Logic, ZIBRA Support, and Daily Commission Rules.

STATUS:
- Director economics locked
- ZIBRA Director explanations safe
- Simulations passed
- Permissions validated

OBJECTIVE:
Finalize Director onboarding UX, lifecycle (suspension/termination), appeals, and ZIBRA handling — WITHOUT changing commission logic or exposing revenue.

DO NOT:
- Modify commission formulas
- Expose platform earnings
- Create guarantees
- Break existing Director logic

====================================================
PHASE 16 — DIRECTOR ONBOARDING UX (FINAL)
====================================================

Design Director onboarding flows for BOTH Director types.

A) CONTRACT DIRECTOR ONBOARDING
Steps:
1. Intro screen:
   - Explain role as “Driver Network Manager”
   - Explain responsibility (performance, discipline)
   - State that earnings are variable and not guaranteed
2. Referral Code screen:
   - Show unique referral code
   - Explain drivers signed up via code are auto-assigned
3. Activation rules screen:
   - Minimum 10 drivers required
   - Commission eligibility is daily and capped
4. Agreement screen:
   - Terms acceptance
   - Performance & conduct obligations
5. Dashboard entry:
   - Show counts only (no money)

B) EMPLOYED DIRECTOR ONBOARDING
Steps:
1. Role explanation
2. Assigned drivers overview
3. Authority limits
4. Compliance & performance expectations
5. Dashboard entry

====================================================
PHASE 17 — DIRECTOR LIFECYCLE STATES
====================================================

Define Director states:
- pending
- active
- suspended
- terminated

Rules:
- suspended → no commissions, no driver actions
- terminated → drivers reassigned automatically
- status changes only by Admin or Super Admin
- all state changes logged

ZIBRA must:
- Explain status clearly
- Never argue
- Never promise reinstatement

====================================================
PHASE 18 — DIRECTOR APPEALS & DISPUTES
====================================================

When Director is suspended or terminated:
- Allow “Submit Appeal” button
- Appeal includes:
  - reason
  - optional explanation
- Appeal visible to Admin/Super Admin
- ZIBRA explains appeal process neutrally:
  “Your appeal will be reviewed. Outcomes depend on policy.”

NO SLA promises.

====================================================
PHASE 19 — ZIBRA CONFLICT & DE-ESCALATION RULES
====================================================

ZIBRA must handle:
- Angry Directors
- Accusations of cheating
- Threats to quit
- Requests for internal data

ZIBRA response rules:
- Acknowledge emotion
- Restate policy
- Redirect to actions Director controls
- Offer appeal or admin review
- Never escalate emotionally

====================================================
PHASE 20 — DIRECTOR TERMINATION SAFETY
====================================================

On termination:
- Freeze commissions immediately
- Reassign drivers automatically
- Notify Director via Inbox
- ZIBRA explains:
  “Your Director role has been ended based on review. Driver assignments have been updated.”

No blame language.

====================================================
