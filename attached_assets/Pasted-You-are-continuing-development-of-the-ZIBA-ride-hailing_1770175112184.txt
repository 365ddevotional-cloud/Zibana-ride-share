You are continuing development of the ZIBA ride-hailing platform.

PHASE 3 GOAL:
Build a complete driver-only dashboard that shows availability, trip activity, and earnings.
This must feel like a separate Driver App, not an extension of the Rider App.

EXECUTE ALL STEPS BELOW IN ORDER WITHOUT SKIPPING.

1. DRIVER DASHBOARD LAYOUT
Update /src/driver/pages/DriverDashboard.tsx

Dashboard must include:
- Driver welcome header (driver name)
- Driver status toggle (ONLINE / OFFLINE)
- Active trip panel
- Incoming ride requests panel
- Earnings summary panel

NO rider UI elements allowed.

2. DRIVER STATUS CONTROL
- Driver can toggle ONLINE / OFFLINE
- Status must be stored (backend or mocked)
- When OFFLINE:
  - Driver cannot receive ride requests
- When ONLINE:
  - Driver can receive ride requests

3. INCOMING RIDE REQUESTS (SIMULATED OK)
- Show a list of incoming ride requests
- Each request includes:
  - Pickup location
  - Dropoff location
  - Estimated fare
- Provide Accept / Reject buttons
- Requests must be driver-specific

Mock data allowed if backend is incomplete.

4. ACTIVE TRIP VIEW
When a trip is accepted:
- Show Active Trip section with:
  - Rider name (minimal info)
  - Pickup → Dropoff
  - Trip status
- Hide incoming requests once trip is active

5. EARNINGS SUMMARY
Show:
- Today’s earnings
- Total earnings (mock allowed)
- Completed trips count

Driver must ONLY see their own earnings.

6. DATA ISOLATION (MANDATORY)
- Driver must see ONLY:
  - Trips assigned to them
  - Their earnings
- No access to:
  - Rider wallets
  - Rider trip history
  - Other drivers' data

7. UI SEPARATION RULES
- Use DriverLayout only
- Different spacing/colors from Rider App
- Clear “Driver Dashboard” labeling

8. SAFETY & VALIDATION
- All data fetches must use driverId from session
- Role checks must be enforced server-side
- No shared global state with Rider App

9. VERIFICATION CHECKLIST
Confirm:
- Driver dashboard loads correctly
- Status toggle works
- Incoming requests appear only when ONLINE
- Active trip flow works
- Earnings display correctly
- Rider/Admin cannot access dashboard
- No console or runtime errors

STOP AFTER COMPLETION.
Do NOT proceed to Phase 4 until Phase 3 is confirmed complete.
