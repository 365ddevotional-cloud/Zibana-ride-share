You are now acting as the senior engineer responsible for fixing a role-based routing bug in the ZIBA app.

PROBLEM:
Whenever a user signs in as a DRIVER, the app incorrectly redirects them to the Rider App instead of the Driver App.

GOAL:
Fix all role-based redirect logic so that after successful authentication:
- RIDER → Rider App
- DRIVER → Driver App
- ADMIN → Admin Web

Then TEST and CONFIRM each separation works and report the correct URLs.

EXECUTION INSTRUCTIONS (DO NOT SKIP STEPS):

1. AUDIT AUTH FLOW
- Inspect login logic for RiderLogin, DriverLogin, and shared auth handlers.
- Locate any hardcoded redirects such as navigate("/") or navigate("/rider").
- Identify any global redirect logic in AuthContext, useAuth, or similar.

2. FIX ROLE-BASED REDIRECT (CRITICAL)
- Implement explicit role-based routing AFTER login success:
    - role === "RIDER"  → navigate("/")
    - role === "DRIVER" → navigate("/driver")
    - role === "ADMIN"  → navigate("/admin")
- Remove any default redirect that forces all users to "/".

3. FIX DRIVER LOGIN PAGE
- Ensure DriverLogin.tsx:
    - Blocks non-DRIVER roles
    - Redirects ONLY to /driver on success
    - Never redirects to "/" or rider routes

4. VERIFY AUTH CONTEXT / SESSION LOGIC
- Ensure user.role is read from backend response or token
- Ensure role comparison uses exact values: "RIDER", "DRIVER", "ADMIN"
- Ensure no lowercase or mismatched role strings

5. VERIFY ROUTE GUARDS
- Rider routes must block DRIVER and ADMIN
- Driver routes must block RIDER and ADMIN
- Admin routes must block RIDER and DRIVER
- Guards must NOT redirect users to another role’s app

6. TEST ALL THREE FLOWS
Create or use test accounts for:
- RIDER
- DRIVER
- ADMIN

For each role:
- Log in
- Confirm correct redirect
- Confirm other apps are inaccessible

7. FINAL VALIDATION
- No console errors
- No redirect loops
- Refreshing the page keeps the user in the correct app
- Backend role checks remain enforced

8. REPORT RESULTS
After fixes and testing, respond with:
- Confirmation that the bug is fixed
- The exact working URLs for:
    - Rider App
    - Driver App
    - Admin Web
- Any files that were changed

IMPORTANT RULES:
- Do NOT refactor unrelated code
- Do NOT break Rider or Admin apps
- Make the minimal correct fix
- Ensure production-safe behavior
