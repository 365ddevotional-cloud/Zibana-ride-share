You are fixing and completing the ZIBA Welcome / Landing Page UX.

OBJECTIVE:
Make every visible box, card, button, and section on the ZIBA welcome page clickable,
functional, and consistent with the ZIBA platform experience.

No dead UI.
No placeholder cards.
No broken navigation.

If a destination page does not exist, CREATE it.
All routes must be safe for unauthenticated users unless explicitly stated.

=====================================================
PHASE 1 — AUDIT THE WELCOME PAGE
=====================================================

1) Identify ALL non-clickable elements on the welcome page, including:
- Feature cards
- Info boxes
- Sections
- CTA buttons
- Icons
- Badges

2) List them under:
- Existing route available
- Route missing (must be created)

=====================================================
PHASE 2 — MAKE EVERYTHING CLICKABLE
=====================================================

For EACH of the following sections, ensure full card clickability
(not just buttons or text):

A) HERO SECTION
- “Get Started” → /signup
- “Learn More” → scroll to “Why choose ZIBA Ride” OR /about

B) WHY CHOOSE ZIBA RIDE
Each card must be clickable:

1) Verified Drivers
→ /safety/verified-drivers
(Create page if missing)

2) Quick Pickup
→ /how-it-works#pickup
(Create page if missing)

3) Easy Booking
→ /how-it-works#booking
(Create page if missing)

C) EVERYTHING YOU NEED
Each feature card must be clickable:

1) Live Tracking
→ /features/live-tracking
(Create page if missing)

2) Flexible Payments
→ /features/payments
(Create page if missing)

3) Rate Your Trip
→ /features/ratings
(Create page if missing)

4) Safety First
→ /safety
(Create page if missing)

D) READY TO RIDE SECTION
- “Get Started” → /signup

=====================================================
PHASE 3 — CREATE MISSING PAGES (LIGHTWEIGHT)
=====================================================

If a destination page does not exist, create a clean, simple public page with:
- ZIBA branding
- Clear heading
- Short explanation
- Relevant icons
- CTA to Sign Up

Pages to create if missing:
- /about
- /how-it-works
- /features/live-tracking
- /features/payments
- /features/ratings
- /safety
- /safety/verified-drivers

Do NOT include login-gated data.
Do NOT expose internal processes.
Do NOT promise outcomes.

=====================================================
PHASE 4 — CONSISTENCY & DESIGN RULES
=====================================================

1) Use the SAME:
- Font family
- Typography scale
- Card radius
- Shadow depth
- Color tokens
as the rest of ZIBA

2) Entire card should be clickable:
- Cursor: pointer
- Hover state
- Tap feedback on mobile

3) Accessibility:
- Proper <a> or router links
- Keyboard navigable
- ARIA labels where appropriate

=====================================================
PHASE 5 — ROUTING & FALLBACK SAFETY
=====================================================

- All welcome-page routes must be public
- If a route errors:
  - Show friendly fallback page
  - Offer “Back to Home” and “Get Started”

=====================================================
PHASE 6 — QA CHECKLIST (MUST PASS)
=====================================================

Confirm:
✔ Every box is clickable
✔ No dead UI
✔ No 404 routes
✔ Mobile & desktop tested
✔ Navigation feels intentional
✔ Branding is consistent
✔ No legal promises added

=====================================================
DELIVERABLES
=====================================================

After completion, report:
1) Which elements were fixed
2) Which pages were created
3) Routes added
4) Screens tested
5) Any deferred improvements

Proceed carefully.
Do NOT break existing auth flows.
Do NOT introduce placeholders.
