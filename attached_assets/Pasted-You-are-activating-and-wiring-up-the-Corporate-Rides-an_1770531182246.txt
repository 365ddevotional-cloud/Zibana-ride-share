You are activating and wiring up the “Corporate Rides” and “Special Rides”
sections on the ZIBA Rider Services screen.

- Do NOT break normal ride or schedule flows

========================================
PHASE 1 — ACTIVATE SERVICES CARDS
========================================

1) ENABLE CLICK INTERACTION
