--------------------------------------------
GOAL
--------------------------------------------

We are SIMPLIFYING and CLEANING the Rider UI.
We are keeping 100% of existing functionality.

We are rearranging layout and improving clarity only.

Everything currently in:
- Home
- Services
- Activity
- Inbox
- Account
Must remain.

Nothing removed.

--------------------------------------------
CLICKABILITY REQUIREMENT (MANDATORY)
--------------------------------------------

Every:
- Button
- Card
- List item
- Menu row
- CTA
- Icon with interaction
Must be clickable and must route to a real existing page or function.

No dead buttons.
No placeholder links.
No non-functional UI.

Every navigated page must:
- Have a clear back path
- Not trap the user
- Maintain navigation bar consistency

After implementation, perform a FULL Rider click-through audit.

--------------------------------------------
HOME SCREEN (DO NOT REMOVE ANY RIDE TYPES)
--------------------------------------------

Keep:
- All ride classes (Go, Plus, Comfort, PetRide, SafeTeen, Elite)
- Payment selector
- Schedule Ride
- Saved Places
- Bottom navigation

Only improve:
- Spacing
- Hierarchy
- Visual clarity
- Make selected ride more visually distinct
- Improve primary "Request Ride" button prominence

Do NOT remove any ride category.

--------------------------------------------
SERVICES TAB
--------------------------------------------

Keep:
- Schedule a Ride
- Corporate Rides
- Special Rides

Improve clarity and spacing only.

Ensure every service card routes correctly.

--------------------------------------------
ACTIVITY TAB
--------------------------------------------

Keep:
- History
- Cancelled
- Penalties

Improve empty state to:
"No completed rides yet. Your trips will appear here."
Add clear button: "Book a ride"
That routes to Home.

--------------------------------------------
INBOX
--------------------------------------------

Keep existing announcements.
Ensure tapping message opens full message view.
Ensure settings icon routes properly.

--------------------------------------------
ACCOUNT PAGE (PRESERVE ALL SECTIONS)
--------------------------------------------

Keep:
- Profile
- Payment Methods
- Saved Places
- Trips
- Inbox
- Settings
- Notifications
- Marketing
- Data Usage
- Trusted Contacts
- Ride PIN
- Emergency
- Help Center
- Terms & Privacy
- Log Out
- Delete Account

Do NOT remove or hide anything.

Only:
- Improve grouping spacing
- Improve visual hierarchy
- Ensure each row routes properly

--------------------------------------------
INTEGRATE DRIVER FEEDBACK (FROM NIGERIA SURVEY)
--------------------------------------------

Without backend logic changes:

1) Add subtle UI badges that show:
   - Fair matching
   - Safety priority
   - Star-based accountability

2) In ride selection area, add small note:
   "Drivers are matched based on fairness and rating."

3) In Activity or Account → Safety:
   Add visible reassurance text:
   "Low-rated users are not re-matched."

4) Improve visibility of:
   - Ride PIN
   - Emergency
   - Trusted Contacts

This shows we are listening to drivers and riders.

No backend changes required.

--------------------------------------------
FINAL VALIDATION
--------------------------------------------

After changes:
- Test every tab.
- Tap every visible UI element.
- Confirm it navigates correctly.
- Confirm no UI elements disappeared.
- Confirm no logic was modified.

Return summary of:
- Files modified
- Screens affected
- Navigation verification results

Proceed carefully and conservatively.
