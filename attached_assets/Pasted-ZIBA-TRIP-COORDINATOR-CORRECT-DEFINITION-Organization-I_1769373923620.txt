ZIBA “TRIP COORDINATOR” — CORRECT DEFINITION

(Organization / Institutional Rider Account)

🔑 What a Trip Coordinator IS

A Trip Coordinator is an organization (not an admin, not staff) that:

Signs up to ZIBA

Has its own account

Books rides for third-party beneficiaries
(clients, members, patients, students, staff, etc.)

Think:

NGOs

Hospitals

Churches

Schools

Government programs

Corporate transport desks

Community programs

➡️ This is a specialized Rider-type account, not platform governance.
