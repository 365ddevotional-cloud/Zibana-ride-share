You are working on the ZIBA Ride Share platform (Rider App, Driver App, Admin Dashboard).

GOAL:
Design and implement the ZIBA Safe Return Hub system for lost items in a way that improves safety, reduces conflict, protects drivers, reassures riders, and strengthens brand trust — WITHOUT breaking existing ride, wallet, or trust-score logic.

IMPORTANT CONSTRAINTS:
- Do NOT remove existing lost-item reporting flows
- Do NOT expose driver phone numbers to riders by default
- Do NOT expose rider phone numbers to drivers until item is confirmed found
- All logic must be server-side enforced
- Everything must be auditable in Admin
- Extend existing systems; do not rewrite them

====================================================
1️⃣ SAFE RETURN HUB — CORE CONCEPT
====================================================

Implement a new optional lost-item return method called:
"ZIBA Safe Return Hub"

Definition:
A Safe Return Hub is a ZIBA-approved neutral drop-off location where a driver can safely deposit a found item for rider pickup.

Safe Return Hubs include:
- Partner fuel stations
- Supermarkets
- Pharmacies
- Hotels
- ZIBA offices
- Approved corporate partners

Each hub must have:
- Name
- Location (lat/lng + address)
- Operating hours
- Contact person (optional)
- Status (active / inactive)
- City coverage
- CCTV / verification flag (boolean)

====================================================
2️⃣ LOST ITEM FLOW (END-TO-END)
====================================================

STEP A — Rider Reports Lost Item
- Rider selects a completed trip
- Submits:
  - Item category
  - Description
  - Optional photo
- Status = "reported"

STEP B — Driver Confirmation
- Driver receives notification
- Driver selects:
  - "Item not found"
  - "Item found"
- If "Item found":
  - System unlocks in-app messaging
  - System temporarily reveals rider phone number to driver ONLY
  - Rider does NOT see driver phone number yet
- Status = "found"

STEP C — Return Method Selection
Driver chooses one:
1. Direct meet-up with rider
2. ZIBA Safe Return Hub (recommended)

====================================================
3️⃣ SAFE RETURN HUB FLOW
====================================================

If driver selects "Safe Return Hub":

- System suggests nearest available hubs
- Driver selects hub
- System records:
  - hub_id
  - expected drop-off time
- Status = "en_route_to_hub"

At hub:
- Driver marks "Item dropped at hub"
- Uploads confirmation photo
- Hub staff (or driver self-confirmation) verifies receipt
- Status = "at_hub"

Rider:
- Receives notification
- Sees hub details and pickup instructions
- Picks up item
- Confirms pickup in app
- Status = "returned"

====================================================
4️⃣ COMMUNICATION & PRIVACY RULES
====================================================

- In-app messaging enabled after item is marked "found"
- Driver sees rider phone number ONLY after confirmation
- Rider sees driver phone number ONLY AFTER item is marked "returned"
- All chats are logged and visible to Admin
- Phone numbers auto-expire after case closure

====================================================
5️⃣ PAYMENTS, INCENTIVES & PROFIT ALIGNMENT
====================================================

Driver Incentives:
- Lost-item reward configurable in Admin
- Bonus reward for Safe Return Hub usage
- Trust score increase for successful returns

Rider Costs:
- Optional return fee
- Hub service fee (configurable)
- Waived if Admin intervenes or fault not rider’s

ZIBA Benefits:
- Reduced disputes
- Clear audit trail
- Partner revenue opportunities
- Strong safety branding

====================================================
6️⃣ TRUST SCORE & FRAUD PREVENTION
====================================================

Trust Score Logic:
- Driver:
  + Successful return → score increase
  - Confirmed abuse → score decrease
- Rider:
  - Repeated false claims → score decrease
  - Legitimate claims → no penalty

AI Fraud Detection:
- Detect repeated lost-item reports by same rider
- Flag unusual frequency or patterns
- Escalate to Admin automatically

====================================================
7️⃣ ADMIN DASHBOARD (NEW MODULE)
====================================================

Add "Lost Items & Safe Return" section with:
- All lost-item cases
- Filters by:
  - Status
  - City
  - Hub
  - Driver
  - Rider
- View full timeline
- View chat logs
- Override decisions
- Manually close cases
- Configure:
  - Rewards
  - Fees
  - Trust score impact
  - Hub availability

====================================================
8️⃣ DRIVER APP UI (CLEAR & SIMPLE)
====================================================

Driver Screens:
- Lost item notification
- Item confirmation screen
- Return method selection
- Safe Return Hub map selection
- Drop-off confirmation screen
- Reward confirmation

Include driver education:
"Using a Safe Return Hub protects you and earns extra trust points."

====================================================
9️⃣ RIDER APP UI (REASSURING & FRIENDLY)
====================================================

Rider Screens:
- Lost item report
- Status tracking
- Hub pickup instructions
- Pickup confirmation
- Thank-you message

Include reassurance copy:
"Your item is safe and monitored by ZIBA."

====================================================
🔟 TERMS & CONDITIONS (STORE-READY)
====================================================

Add clauses covering:
- ZIBA not liable for unreported items
- Safe Return Hub is optional but recommended
- Rewards are goodwill incentives, not guarantees
- Fraud or abuse leads to suspension
- All decisions logged and auditable

====================================================
1️⃣1️⃣ SAFETY & EDGE CASE HANDLING
====================================================

Handle cases:
- Driver refuses to return
- Rider never picks up item
- Item damaged
- Item unclaimed after X days
- False claims

Admin must have override controls for all.

====================================================
1️⃣2️⃣ IMPLEMENTATION RULE
====================================================

Before coding:
- Check existing lost-item logic
- Reuse existing wallet, trust score, messaging systems
- Only ADD missing parts
- Ensure nothing breaks
- Test end-to-end before marking complete

FINAL OBJECTIVE:
Create a Safe Return system where:
✔ Drivers feel protected
✔ Riders feel reassured
✔ ZIBA reduces conflict
✔ Trust and safety improve
✔ Platform reputation strengthens
