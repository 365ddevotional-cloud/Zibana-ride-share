You are continuing execution of the ZIBA platform.

STATUS:
- Director logic finalized
- ZIBRA Support stable
- Onboarding & lifecycle complete
- Permissions & simulations passed

OBJECTIVE:
Prepare ZIBA for PUBLIC LAUNCH by finalizing training, performance monitoring, store compliance, and operational readiness — without changing economics, commissions, or authority structures.

DO NOT:
- Change Director commission logic
- Expose platform revenue
- Rename ZIBRA / ZIBA Support
- Break any existing flow

====================================================

A) CONTRACT DIRECTOR TRAINING
Topics:
- How driver activity affects eligibility
- Daily variability explained
- Managing suspensions responsibly
- Keeping drivers compliant
- What Directors can and cannot do
- How to avoid abuse flags

B) EMPLOYED DIRECTOR TRAINING

Training format:
- Short cards

====================================================
PHASE 23 — PERFORMANCE & HEALTH ALERTS
====================================================

Add NON-FINANCIAL alerts:

Director alerts:
- Driver activity dropping
- High suspension rate
- Approaching cell cap (1,300)
- Low active driver percentage

Admin alerts:
- Director abuse patterns
- Excessive suspensions
- Appeal volume spikes

ZIBRA may explain alerts, but never enforce actions.

====================================================
PHASE 24 — APP STORE & PLAY STORE COMPLIANCE (FINAL)
====================================================

Verify compliance:

1) Automation disclosure
- ZIBA Support described as “automated assistance”
- No claims of human or AI deception

2) Permissions
- Notifications explained clearly
- Location usage explained
- No dark patterns

3) Safety language
- ZIBA is a facilitator
- No guarantees
- Clear responsibility boundaries

4) Accessibility
- Font size readable
- Contrast acceptable
- No blocked navigation

====================================================
PHASE 25 — OPERATIONAL READINESS
====================================================

Prepare Admin tools:
- Director overview dashboard
- Driver health overview
- Appeal queue
- ZIBRA logs viewer
- Emergency suspend controls

Prepare Playbooks:
- Director suspension playbook
- Mass driver issue playbook
- Lost-item abuse playbook
- Incident response playbook

====================================================
PHASE 26 — FINAL LAUNCH CHECKLIST
====================================================

Confirm:
✔ All roles tested (Rider, Driver, Director, Admin, Super Admin)
✔ ZIBRA responses safe and calm
✔ No commission exposure
✔ Appeals and suspensions work
✔ Training acknowledged
✔ Store compliance passed

OUTPUT:
1) Training content summary
2) Alerts implemented

Proceed carefully.
Do NOT mark launch-ready until all checks pass.
