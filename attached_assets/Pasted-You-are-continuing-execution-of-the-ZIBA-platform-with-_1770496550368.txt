You are continuing execution of the ZIBA platform with FINALIZED Director Logic and ZIBRA Support.

STATUS:
- Director structure locked
- 77% daily active rule locked
- Caps locked (1,300 total / 1,000 commissionable)
- ZIBRA Director Mode implemented

OBJECTIVE:
Simulate real-world Director scenarios, stress-test logic, validate permissions, and ensure ZIBRA responses remain safe, calm, and legally protected.

DO NOT:
- Change commission rules
- Expose platform earnings
- Expose commission amounts
- Modify existing flows unless fixing a bug

====================================================
PHASE 10 — REAL-WORLD DIRECTOR DAILY SIMULATIONS
====================================================

Simulate DAILY scenarios for Contract Directors.

SCENARIO SET A — NORMAL DAYS
- Director with 10 drivers → verify:
  - Commission activates
  - Only 77% of active drivers count
- Director with 50 drivers → verify:
  - Commissionable drivers = floor(77%)
- Director with 1,200 drivers → verify:
  - Commissionable drivers capped at 1,000

Confirm:
- Only ACTIVE drivers (worked ≥1 trip) are counted
- Inactive drivers excluded
- Calculations reset daily

====================================================
PHASE 11 — EDGE & FAILURE SCENARIOS
====================================================

SCENARIO SET B — EDGE CASES

1) Director has 9 drivers
   - No commission
   - ZIBRA explains activation requirement

2) Director has 30 drivers but only 8 worked today
   - Commissionable drivers = floor(77% of 8)
   - ZIBRA explains low activity impact

3) Director reaches 1,300 drivers
   - New driver signup blocked or flagged
   - Admin notified

4) Director tries to deactivate driver
   - Action blocked
   - ZIBRA explains authority limit

5) Director suspends driver
   - Suspension allowed
   - Driver excluded from active count

====================================================
PHASE 12 — ZIBRA STRESS-TEST (DIRECTOR CONVERSATIONS)
====================================================

Simulate Director messages:

- “Why didn’t I earn today?”
- “I recruited 100 drivers, why am I capped?”
- “ZIBA is cheating me”
- “Show me how much the platform made”
- “I want to deactivate this driver now”

ZIBRA must:
- Stay calm
- Explain structure
- Never show money
- Never admit fault
- Never argue
- Redirect to performance & policy

====================================================
PHASE 13 — PERMISSION & SECURITY TESTS
====================================================

Verify:
- Directors cannot:
  - See platform revenue
  - See commissions
  - Modify rules
  - Access Admin panels
- Directors can:
  - Activate referral drivers
  - Suspend drivers
- Admin & Super Admin override everything

====================================================
PHASE 14 — LOGGING & AUDIT CONFIRMATION
====================================================

Ensure logs capture:
- Director actions (activate, suspend)
- Daily eligibility calculations
- ZIBRA Director conversations
- Admin overrides

Logs must include:
- actorId
- role
- timestamp
- action
- affected driverId(s)

====================================================
PHASE 15 — FINAL ACCEPTANCE CHECK
====================================================

Confirm:
✔ Daily commission logic stable
✔ Caps enforced correctly
✔ No revenue leakage
✔ ZIBRA explanations accurate
✔ Admin supremacy intact
✔ No legal promises anywhere

Output:
1) Simulation results
2) Any bugs found + fixed
3) Confirmation of Director readiness

Proceed carefully and do not mark complete until ALL scenarios pass.
