SYSTEM INSTRUCTION:
You are fixing and extending the ZIBA Ride Share application. Make changes carefully, safely, and incrementally. Do not break existing functionality.

TASK GROUP 1: FIX PAYMENT METHOD ERRORS (CRITICAL)

1. Fix the error "Could not update payment method":
   - Ensure the backend accepts "cash" and "wallet" as valid payment methods.
   - If the wallet balance is ₦0.00, allow wallet selection but show a non-blocking notice prompting funding.
   - Do NOT throw an error when switching between cash and wallet.

2. Fix "Add Payment Method" not being clickable:
   - Enable the button to open a "Fund Wallet" flow instead of adding a direct card.
   - Ensure the button works on mobile (iOS Safari / Android Chrome).
   - Remove any disabled overlay, z-index, or pointer-events issues.
   - Confirm tap targets work on small screens.

TASK GROUP 2: CARD PAYMENTS VIA WALLET ONLY (NO DIRECT CARD RIDES)

3. Implement Card → Wallet funding ONLY:
   - Riders may add a debit/credit card.
   - Cards can ONLY be used to fund the ZIBA Wallet.
   - Trips may be paid using:
     a) Cash
     b) Wallet balance
   - Do NOT allow direct card payment for trips.
   - Clearly label this as "Fund Wallet with Card".

4. Wallet funding rules:
   - Show success and failure states clearly.
   - Wallet balance updates instantly after successful funding.
   - Failed funding attempts show friendly, retryable messages.
   - Store transaction references for support review.

TASK GROUP 3: CANCELLATION RULE UPDATE (IMPORTANT)

5. Update rider cancellation logic:
   - If rider cancels BEFORE driver accepts → no charge.
   - If rider cancels AFTER driver accepts BUT within 3 minutes → no charge.
   - If rider cancels AFTER 3 minutes while driver is on the way → apply cancellation fee.
   - Clearly log cancellation reason and timing.

6. Update Help Center cancellation content to reflect this rule clearly and consistently.
