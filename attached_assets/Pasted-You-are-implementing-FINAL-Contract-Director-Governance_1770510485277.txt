You are implementing FINAL Contract Director Governance for the ZIBA platform.

THIS PROMPT IS AUTHORITATIVE AND OVERRIDES PRIOR ASSUMPTIONS.
Do NOT change commission logic.
Do NOT expose platform revenue.
Do NOT break existing flows.

====================================================
PHASE 27 — CONTRACT DIRECTOR LIFESPAN
====================================================

Implement lifespan controls for Contract Directors:
- lifespan_start_date
- lifespan_end_date
- status auto-updates on expiry

Rules:
- Lifespan set/updated by Admin or Super Admin only
- On expiry:
  - Director status → suspended
  - Commissions frozen
  - Driver cells locked pending review
- ZIBRA notifies Director before expiry (14 days, 7 days, 1 day)

====================================================
PHASE 28 — MULTI-CELL SUPPORT
====================================================

Enable up to 3 driver cells per Contract Director.

Each cell:
- Max drivers: 1,300
- Max commissionable drivers per day: 1,000
- 77% daily active rule applies per cell

Dashboard must show:
- Cell 1 / Cell 2 / Cell 3
- Counts only (no money)

====================================================
PHASE 29 — DIRECTOR DASHBOARD (PRIVATE)
====================================================

Create Director Dashboard:
- Visible only to Director, Admin, Super Admin
- Separate from Admin dashboard

Include:
- Driver counts (per cell)
- Active drivers today
- Commissionable drivers today
- Staff list & roles
- Alerts & performance prompts

====================================================
PHASE 30 — DIRECTOR STAFF & TEAM ROLES
====================================================

Allow Contract Directors to create Staff accounts.

Rules:
- Staff roles are scoped (section-level access)
- Staff cannot see full dashboard unless permitted
- Admin/Super Admin must approve staff roles
- Directors can discipline staff with Admin permission

====================================================
PHASE 31 — AUDIT & ACCOUNTABILITY
====================================================

Log ALL actions:
- actorId
- role
- action
- target
- timestamp
- before/after state

Logs visible to Admin & Super Admin only.

====================================================
PHASE 32 — ZIBRA DIRECTOR PERFORMANCE COACHING
====================================================

ZIBRA must:
- Monitor Director performance trends
- Send proactive coaching prompts
- Warn about:
  - Low activity
  - High suspensions
  - Cell health
  - Lifespan expiry
- Use calm, non-threatening language
- Never promise earnings
- Never expose financials

====================================================
PHASE 33 — FINAL VALIDATION
====================================================

Confirm:
✔ Lifespan enforcement works
✔ 3-cell limit enforced
✔ Director dashboards isolated
✔ Staff permissions scoped
✔ Audit trail complete
✔ ZIBRA coaching active
✔ Admin/Super Admin supremacy intact

Do NOT mark complete until all checks pass.
