CONTEXT:
App: ZIBA
Priority: Driver soft-launch testing
IMPORTANT:
- DO NOT touch Rider app (UI, routes, logic, auth).
- DO NOT refactor or redesign anything.
- Make the SMALLEST POSSIBLE backend + admin fixes.
- Goal: Allow DRIVER TRAINEES / TESTERS to bypass document approval.

CURRENT PROBLEM:
- Driver trainee (example: smefas37@gmail.com) is added via Training Management.
- Trainees should NOT wait for document approval.
- Documents still show “Pending Review”.
- There is no admin UI to approve tester documents.
- This blocks testing unnecessarily.

DESIRED BEHAVIOR:
Any DRIVER marked as a TRAINING / TESTER account should:
- Automatically have ALL documents treated as APPROVED
- Be able to go online immediately
- Never be blocked by document verification

SCOPE:
Driver app + backend ONLY.
No Rider changes.

TASKS (DO ALL, MINIMAL CODE):

1️⃣ DEFINE TESTER / TRAINEE FLAG (BACKEND)
- Identify existing indicator for training drivers:
  - Either:
    - driver.isTraining === true
    - OR driver.trainingType === "DRIVER"
    - OR presence in Training Management table
- DO NOT create new tables if one already exists.

2️⃣ AUTO-APPROVE DOCUMENTS FOR TRAINEES
Backend logic change ONLY:
- When fetching driver documents:
  IF driver is TRAINING / TESTER:
    - Return document status as "APPROVED" for:
      - Identity Verification
      - Driver’s License
      - NIN Verification
      - Address Verification
    - Even if no file exists.

IMPORTANT:
- This override applies ONLY to training/test drivers.
- Normal drivers still follow real document approval flow.

3️⃣ PREVENT “PENDING REVIEW” UI FOR TESTERS
Frontend (Driver Documents page only):
- If backend response says:
  - isTraining === true
- Then:
  - Hide “Pending Review”
  - Show “Approved (Test Mode)” badge
  - Disable upload button (optional but preferred)

NO new UI components. Simple conditional rendering.

4️⃣ ENSURE GO-ONLINE IS NOT BLOCKED
Backend:
- If driver is TRAINING / TESTER:
  - Ignore document verification checks entirely.
  - Allow go-online if:
    - driver.approved === true
    - driver.isActive === true

5️⃣ OPTIONAL (CHEAP BUT HELPFUL):
Admin Dashboard:
- In Training Management list:
  - Add a small label: “Documents auto-approved (Test Mode)”
  - Text only. No new actions or buttons.

---

RULES:
- DO NOT add new approval workflows.
- DO NOT add new storage.
- DO NOT touch Rider app.
- DO NOT add background jobs.
- Keep all changes minimal and reversible.

---

DELIVERABLE:
After changes, confirm:
- Trainer/test driver sees all documents as APPROVED
- No “Pending Review” for trainees
- Trainee can go online immediately
- Normal drivers are unchanged

EXECUTE CAREFULLY. MINIMAL CODE. LOW COST.
