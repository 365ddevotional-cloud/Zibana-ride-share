You are implementing DIRECTOR PERFORMANCE SCORING & AUTO-INCENTIVES
for the ZIBA platform.

This system evaluates Director effectiveness, protects ZIBA legally,
and enables data-driven rewards or restrictions.

DO NOT create employment guarantees.
DO NOT auto-pay commissions outside existing commission rules.
DO NOT override Admin or Super Admin authority.
