You are fixing authorization consistency and admin user resolution in the ZIBA Ride Share app.

TASK 1 — FIX ADMIN MANAGEMENT USER DISPLAY (ALL ENVIRONMENTS):

Problem:
- Admin Management table sometimes shows numeric userId instead of name/email in Incognito and Published.
- Preview works partially due to cached auth context.

Fix:
- Update the backend `getAllAdmins()` (or equivalent) to ALWAYS return a fully hydrated user object.
- Enforce a required JOIN between Admin and User tables.
- The API response MUST include:

{
  id,
  role,
  adminStartAt,
  adminEndAt,
  adminPermissions,
  user: {
    id,
    firstName,
    lastName,
    email
  }
}

- If a related user is missing, return a hard error (do NOT fall back to IDs).
- Update frontend Admin Management table to:
  - Render `${user.firstName} ${user.lastName}`
  - Render `user.email`
  - NEVER render raw numeric IDs.

TASK 2 — FIX AUTH ROLE RESOLUTION (PREVIEW ≠ INCORRECT ANYMORE):

Problem:
- Replit Preview still auto-assigns Rider role to non-super-admin emails.
- This causes `365ddevotional@gmail.com` to become Rider even after being rejected as admin.

Fix:
- Centralize role resolution in ONE function used by:
  - Preview
  - Incognito
  - Published app

Rules:
- Define SUPER_ADMIN_EMAIL = "mosesafonabi951@gmail.com"
- Role resolution logic MUST be:

IF email === SUPER_ADMIN_EMAIL:
  role = "super_admin"
ELSE IF user has explicit admin record:
  role = "admin"
ELSE:
  role = "user"   // DO NOT auto-assign rider

- REMOVE any legacy logic that auto-creates rider profiles on login.
- Rider role must ONLY be assigned through explicit rider signup flow.

TASK 3 — ENFORCE ENVIRONMENT PARITY:

- Remove any Preview-only overrides.
- Auth, role, and admin checks must rely ONLY on:
  - Database
  - Email match
- No environment-specific shortcuts allowed.

FINAL VALIDATION:
1. Incognito login as mosesafonabi951@gmail.com → full SUPER ADMIN access
2. Incognito login as 365ddevotional@gmail.com → normal user, NO admin, NO rider
3. Admin Management table shows names + emails everywhere
4. No numeric IDs visible in UI
5. Preview, Incognito, Published behave identically

Apply fixes, run migrations if needed, and confirm.
