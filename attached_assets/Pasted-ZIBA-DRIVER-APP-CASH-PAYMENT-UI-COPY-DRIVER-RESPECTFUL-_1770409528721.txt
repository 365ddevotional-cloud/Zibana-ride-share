====================================
IMPORTANT COPY RULES (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
====================================

• Never show platform percentages during trips
• Never show platform deductions per cash trip
• Never use warning or threatening language
• Never imply money is being taken immediately
• Always emphasize driver-first collection

====================================
FINAL COPY PRINCIPLE
====================================

Driver should always feel:
“I collected my earnings.
ZIBA handles the rest quietly.”

Any copy that creates resentment is a defect.
