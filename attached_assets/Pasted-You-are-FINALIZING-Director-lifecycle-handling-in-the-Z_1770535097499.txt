You are FINALIZING Director lifecycle handling in the ZIBA platform.

GOAL:
- Complete Director reporting (read-only, safe)
- Handle termination / suspension without breaking drivers
- Reassign drivers cleanly
- Maintain full auditability
- Keep Admin / Super Admin authority intact

================================================
PHASE 1 — DIRECTOR REPORTS (READ-ONLY)
================================================

1) DIRECTOR REPORTS DASHBOARD

Director can view:
- Daily summary:
  - Active drivers
  - Commissionable drivers count
- Weekly summary:
  - Driver activity trends
  - Compliance indicators
- Monthly summary:
  - Performance rating (non-financial)
  - Growth / decline indicators

Rules:
- NO raw money values
- NO per-driver revenue
- Percentages and counts only

================================================
PHASE 2 — ADMIN / SUPER ADMIN REPORT VIEW
================================================

2) ADMIN VIEW

Admin / Super Admin can:
- View all director reports
- Compare directors
- Export reports (counts + ratios only)
- Flag directors for review

================================================
PHASE 3 — DIRECTOR TERMINATION & SUSPENSION
================================================

3) DIRECTOR STATUS CHANGES

Statuses:
- Active
- Suspended
- Terminated
- Expired (lifespan ended)

Only Super Admin can:

================================================
PHASE 4 — DRIVER HANDLING ON DIRECTOR TERMINATION
================================================

4) DRIVER REASSIGNMENT RULES

PHASE 5 — MULTI-CELL HANDLING
================================================
