TITLE: Fix Rider Payment UX — Cash Update Error & Add Payment Method Button

DO NOT TOUCH ANY OTHER PART OF THE APP.
DO NOT REWORK SIMULATION.
DO NOT CHANGE DRIVER FLOWS.
“Got it” IS ALREADY FIXED — LEAVE IT AS IS.

====================================

ISSUE 1: “Could not update payment method” error when selecting Cash

PROBLEM:
When a rider selects CASH as payment, the app attempts to update the payment method via a backend API.
That API fails in test/simulation mode, causing a red error banner:
“Update failed – Could not update payment method”.

THIS IS WRONG UX.

REQUIRED FIX (MANDATORY):
1. CASH must be treated as a LOCAL-ONLY payment option.
2. Selecting CASH must:
   - NOT call any backend API
   - NOT attempt to persist payment method server-side
   - NOT trigger any error banners
3. CASH selection must:
   - Update UI state immediately
   - Be stored only in local state / session
   - Always be allowed even when wallet balance = ₦0.00
4. Backend payment update APIs must ONLY be called for:
   - CARD
   - WALLET

ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA:
- Selecting CASH never shows an error
- CASH always works in test/simulation mode
- Switching between CASH and WALLET never fails

====================================

ISSUE 2: “Add Payment Method” button is not clickable

PROBLEM:
The “Add Payment Method” button appears enabled but does nothing.
This creates dead taps and will cause Play Store / App Store rejection.

REQUIRED FIX (MANDATORY):
1. The “Add Payment Method” button MUST be clickable.
2. In TEST / SIMULATION MODE:
   - DO NOT open any real card or payment flow
   - DO NOT silently disable the button
3. Instead, tapping the button must open an informational modal.

MODAL BEHAVIOR:
- Title: Card Payments Unavailable
- Message:
  “Card payments are disabled in test mode.
   You can continue using cash for trips.
   Card payments will be available in production.”
- Button: OK (closes modal)

IMPORTANT:
- NO backend calls
- NO error banners
- NO dead taps

====================================

FINAL VERIFICATION (MUST TEST ON MOBILE VIEW):
1. Rider selects CASH → no error, instant selection
2. Rider switches CASH ↔ WALLET → no failure
3. Rider taps “Add Payment Method” → modal appears
4. No red error banners appear during normal rider actions

ONLY confirm completion AFTER all steps above pass.
