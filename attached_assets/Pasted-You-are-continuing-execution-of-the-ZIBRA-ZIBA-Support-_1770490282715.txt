You are continuing execution of the ZIBRA (ZIBA Support / Z-Assist) system.

STATUS:
- ZIBRA response library exists
- Personality & safety rules enforced
- Multilingual rules active
- Edge-case simulations passed

OBJECTIVE:
Lock ZIBRA into production by adding analytics, governance, admin controls, and store-compliance readiness WITHOUT changing business logic or pricing.

DO NOT:
- Rename ZIBRA
- Expose the word “AI”
- Change commission visibility
- Break any existing flows

====================================================
PHASE G — ZIBRA ANALYTICS & INTELLIGENCE DASHBOARD
====================================================

Create an ADMIN-ONLY dashboard: **ZIBRA Insights**

Metrics to track:
- Total ZIBRA conversations (daily / weekly / monthly)
- By role: Rider / Driver / Admin / Super Admin
- Top 20 question categories
- Top 20 unresolved escalations
- Average resolution time (before human escalation)
- % conversations resolved without human support
- Abuse flags triggered (lost item, payment disputes, threats)
- Language usage distribution

Display as:
- Charts + tables
- Filter by date, country, role
- Export CSV (admin only)

====================================================
PHASE H — GOVERNANCE & SAFETY CONTROLS
====================================================

Add Super-Admin controls:
- Enable / disable ZIBRA globally
- Enable / disable ZIBRA per role
- Emergency “Safe Mode”:
  - ZIBRA only answers FAQs
  - No contextual or advisory responses
- Phrase blacklist editor (words ZIBRA must never say)
- Escalation threshold settings

All changes must:
- Require confirmation
- Be logged with adminId + timestamp

====================================================
PHASE I — HUMAN ESCALATION PIPELINE
====================================================

When user clicks “Contact Human Support”:
- Create Support Ticket
- Attach:
  - Last 10 ZIBRA messages
  - User role
  - Route context
  - Active entities (rideId, ticketId)
- Ticket statuses:
  - Open
  - In Review
  - Responded
  - Closed

ZIBRA must:
- Stop responding once escalated
- Show neutral holding message:
  “A support agent will review this as soon as possible.”

====================================================
PHASE J — APP STORE & PLAY STORE COMPLIANCE
====================================================

Ensure compliance readiness:

1) Disclosure Language (Settings → Support):
- “ZIBA Support provides general assistance and guidance.”
- “ZIBA does not guarantee outcomes.”

2) Data Handling:
- Conversations logged securely
- No sensitive data exposed
- Users can request data deletion

3) Permissions:
- Notifications explained clearly
- No deceptive prompts

4) Accessibility:
- Readable font sizes
- Clear contrast
- No misleading automation claims

====================================================
PHASE K — FINAL QA & SIGN-OFF
====================================================

Run final checks:
- ZIBRA behaves consistently across Rider / Driver / Admin
- Role boundaries enforced server-side
- Inbox + notifications stable
- No crashes or dead ends
- All disclaimers appear only at strategic points
- No legal promises anywhere

OUTPUT REQUIRED:
1) Summary of analytics added
2) Admin controls implemented
3) How to test each feature
4) App-store readiness confirmation
5) Any remaining optional enhancements

Proceed carefully and confirm completion.
