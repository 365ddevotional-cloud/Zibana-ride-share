You are working on the ZIBA Ride-Share platform.

TASK: Implement the complete “Director Funding Drivers” system with UI, legal protection, fraud prevention, and ZIBRA Support responses — without breaking any existing logic.

CRITICAL RULES:
- Do NOT change pricing splits, platform commission visibility, or driver earnings logic.
- Do NOT convert funding into loans, advances, wages, or repayment schemes.
- Do NOT expose internal calculations to Drivers or Riders.
- All actions must be auditable, reversible only by Admin/Super Admin, and legally safe.

====================================================================
SECTION 1 — DIRECTOR DASHBOARD UI (EXACT SCREENS)
====================================================================

Create a dedicated Director Dashboard accessible ONLY by:
- Contract Directors
- Employee Directors
- Admin
- Super Admin

ROUTES:
- /director/dashboard
- /director/drivers
- /director/funding
- /director/staff
- /director/activity-log

VISIBILITY:
- Directors see ONLY their own cell(s)
- Admin/Super Admin see all
- Every action must store actor_id, role, timestamp, IP

UI SCREENS:

1) Director Overview
- Active Drivers (today)
- Total Drivers in Cell
- Commissionable Drivers Today
- Funding Given (today / week / month)
- Trust Score Summary
- Performance Prompt from ZIBRA

2) Drivers List
- Driver Name / ID
- Status (Active / Suspended / Pending)
- Online Today (Yes/No)
- Fund Wallet Button (if eligible)
- Discipline Options:
  - Warning
  - Temporary Suspension (requires Admin confirmation)

3) Funding Screen
- Select Driver (only assigned)
- Amount Input
- Purpose Tag (required):
  - Ride fuel support
  - Network availability boost
  - Emergency assistance
  - Temporary balance top-up
- Show daily / weekly remaining limits
- Confirmation checkbox:
  “This is support, not a loan or obligation.”

4) Staff Management (Director-Owned)
- Create staff accounts
- Role-based permissions (checkboxes)
- Staff can see ONLY permitted sections
- Director can discipline staff
- Admin/Super Admin override everything

5) Activity Log (Immutable)
- Funding events
- Discipline actions
- Staff changes
- ZIBRA warnings
- Cannot be edited or deleted

====================================================================
SECTION 2 — FINAL LEGAL TERMS WORDING (GLOBAL-READY)
====================================================================

Add the following clauses to Terms & Conditions
(Modular, reusable across all countries):

DIRECTOR FUNDING DISCLAIMER:
“Any wallet funding provided by a Director to a Driver is voluntary support and does not constitute a loan, wage, salary, advance, or repayment obligation. ZIBA does not guarantee continued funding, activity, or earnings.”

NO COERCION CLAUSE:
“Directors may not require, imply, or enforce performance, repayment, or compliance as a condition for wallet funding.”

LIMITATION OF LIABILITY:
“ZIBA facilitates wallet transfers and does not assume responsibility for agreements, expectations, or disputes arising from voluntary support.”

PLATFORM ROLE CLARIFICATION:
“ZIBA is not an employer, lender, or guarantor. Directors act independently within platform rules.”

Include acceptance:
- Driver must accept once (recorded)
- Director must accept once (recorded)

====================================================================
SECTION 3 — FRAUD & ABUSE DETECTION RULES
====================================================================

Create automated monitoring rules:

FLAG CONDITIONS:
- Repeated funding to same driver within short time
- Funding followed by forced driver activity patterns
- Director funding exceeding configured thresholds
- Drivers reporting coercion
- Directors attaching conditions in messages

SYSTEM RESPONSE:
- Soft warning from ZIBRA
- Temporary funding suspension
- Escalation to Admin review
- Trust score impact (Director & Driver)

NO AUTOMATIC PUNISHMENTS WITHOUT ADMIN CONFIRMATION.

====================================================================
SECTION 4 — DIRECTOR FUNDING RULES (ADVANCED)
====================================================================

ELIGIBILITY:
- Director must be active
- Director must have ≥10 drivers
- Driver must be active and assigned

LIMITS:
- Hard caps configurable by Super Admin
- Per-driver daily / weekly / monthly caps
- Per-director total funding caps

ABSOLUTE PROHIBITIONS:
- No repayment
- No deductions
- No conditional funding
- No auto-funding
- No earnings manipulation

DATA MODEL:
DirectorFunding {
  id
  director_id
  driver_id
  amount
  purpose_tag
  created_at
  created_by
  ip_address
}

====================================================================
SECTION 5 — ZIBRA SUPPORT RESPONSE TEMPLATES
====================================================================

ZIBRA (User-Facing Name: “ZIBA Support”)

DIRECTOR TEMPLATES:

Q: “Can I expect repayment?”
A: “Funding is voluntary support and does not involve repayment or obligations.”

Q: “Can I require drivers to stay online?”
A: “Support funding should never be used to influence driver decisions.”

Q: “Why was my funding paused?”
A: “Your funding activity triggered a review to ensure fairness and compliance.”

DRIVER TEMPLATES:

Q: “Do I have to pay this back?”
A: “No. Director funding is voluntary support and not a loan.”

Q: “Can I refuse funding?”
A: “Yes. Accepting support is optional.”

Q: “Can funding affect my account?”
A: “Support funding does not change your earnings or account standing.”

ADMIN TEMPLATES:
- Explain flags
- Guide reviews
- Summarize patterns
- No legal promises

====================================================================
SECTION 6 — WORST-CASE ABUSE SIMULATIONS (MUST PASS)
====================================================================

Simulate and confirm safe outcomes for:

1) Director demands repayment → blocked + logged
2) Driver claims coercion → funding paused + admin alert
3) Excessive funding attempts → hard stop
4) Director staff misuse → role-based restriction enforced
5) Legal threat language → ZIBRA neutral response only

====================================================================
FINAL REQUIREMENTS
====================================================================

- Everything role-aware
- Everything logged
- No legal exposure
- No silent failures
- Confirm each section works end-to-end

Proceed step-by-step.
Do not mark complete until all simulations pass.
