You are fixing the ZIBA Ride Share app. Carefully read and fix ONLY what is described below. Do not guess. Do not invent new logic.

CURRENT STATE (from screenshots & live behavior):

1) Tester Management (Admin side)
- Tester Management now shows Email correctly (good)
- Tester has:
  - Test Credits (₦)
  - Main Wallet (₦)
- Admin can Add Rider Tester / Add Driver Tester
- Admin can Top-Up Tester Credit
- Admin can Refund Tester Credit
→ Admin side is mostly working

BUT THERE ARE CRITICAL ISSUES ON THE USER (RIDER TESTER) SIDE.

---

2) CRITICAL ISSUE #1 — Tester wallet credit NOT usable
- Admin tops up Test Credits successfully
- Tester Management shows large Test Credit balance (₦)
- BUT when the Rider Tester logs in and tries to request a ride:
  → App throws INSUFFICIENT_BALANCE error
- Ride request logic is checking ONLY the Main Wallet
- Test Credits are being completely ignored in ride payment validation

✅ REQUIRED FIX:
- Ride payment validation MUST check:
  - Test Wallet first (for testers)
  - Then Main Wallet (fallback)
- If user is a tester, Test Wallet balance MUST be allowed to pay for rides
- Do NOT block rides if Test Wallet has sufficient balance

---

3) CRITICAL ISSUE #2 — Wallet UI is wrong for Testers
- Rider Tester "Wallet / Payments" screen shows ONLY:
  - "Wallet Balance"
- Tester Wallet (Test Credits) is NOT visible
- This causes confusion and makes testing impossible

✅ REQUIRED FIX:
- Tester users MUST see TWO payment balances:
  1) Main Wallet Balance
  2) Tester Wallet Balance (Test Credits)
- Both balances must be visible in:
  - Wallet screen
  - Payments selection logic
- Tester must be able to choose which wallet to pay from (default to Test Wallet)

---

4) CRITICAL ISSUE #3 — Currency changed incorrectly
- App suddenly shows balances as USD ($)
- System is configured for NGN (₦)
- Tester credits and wallets are ₦-based

✅ REQUIRED FIX:
- Force currency to NGN (₦) everywhere:
  - Wallet UI
  - Tester Wallet
  - Ride pricing
  - Admin views
- Remove USD formatting entirely unless explicitly configured per country

---

5) CRITICAL ISSUE #4 — Payment method logic incomplete
- Tester Wallet exists in admin logic
- But NOT wired into:
  - Ride cost deduction
  - Wallet transaction history
  - Payment method selection

✅ REQUIRED FIX:
- Treat Tester Wallet as a FIRST-CLASS payment method:
  - Deduct from Tester Wallet when used
  - Log transactions properly
  - Show transaction history for Tester Wallet
- Tester Wallet is NOT the same as Main Wallet

---

6) IMPORTANT RULES
- Do NOT remove Main Wallet
- Do NOT merge wallets
- Do NOT auto-convert currencies
- Do NOT guess business logic
- Do NOT break non-tester users

---

FINAL EXPECTED RESULT:
- Admin can add testers, top up, refund (already working)
- Rider Tester sees BOTH wallets clearly
- Ride requests succeed when Test Wallet has balance
- No INSUFFICIENT_BALANCE error if Test Wallet covers ride
- Currency stays ₦ consistently
- System behaves predictably without hidden logic

Proceed step-by-step and fix the root cause properly.
