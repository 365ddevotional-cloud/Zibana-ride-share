ZIBA PRODUCT RULE — CASH & CARD PAYMENTS (DRIVER-RESPECTFUL MODEL)

This rule governs how ZIBA handles CASH and CARD payments to protect driver morale,
avoid resentment, and maintain long-term trust.

THIS RULE OVERRIDES ANY UBER-LIKE CASH LOGIC.

====================================
CORE PRINCIPLES (LOCKED)
====================================
• ZIBA supports BOTH cash payments and card/wallet payments.
• Drivers earn UP TO 80% per trip, not a fixed 80%.
• New drivers may start at ~70% and grow toward 80% based on good standing.
• Driver dignity and clarity take priority over aggressive transparency.
• Platform fees must never create embarrassment or resentment.

====================================
CASH PAYMENT MODEL (PRIMARY)
====================================

1. Rider pays the FULL fare in cash directly to the driver.
2. Driver collects 100% of the cash fare at trip completion.
3. ZIBA does NOT touch or intercept cash payments.
4. The app must clearly show the driver:
   “Cash collected: ₦X / $X”

5. Platform share (up to 20%) is NOT deducted per trip.
6. Platform share is settled LATER via:
   - Wallet balance offset
   - Future card trips
   - Weekly or monthly settlement

7. No platform percentage or deduction is shown at the moment of cash collection.
8. Cash settlement must NEVER occur in the rider’s presence.

====================================
CARD / WALLET PAYMENT MODEL
====================================

1. Rider pays via card or wallet.
2. Driver sees ONLY what they earned for the trip.
3. Platform fee is handled internally.
4. No per-trip platform fee is shown to the driver.

====================================
PLATFORM FEE VISIBILITY (STRICT)
====================================

Platform fees must NEVER be shown:
• To riders (at any time)
• To drivers per trip
• In daily earnings
• In trip history
• In wallet views

Platform fees may ONLY be shown to drivers in:
• Weekly summaries (optional)
• Monthly statements
• Annual tax documents

Platform fees must be:
• Aggregated totals only
• Calmly worded
• No percentages emphasized
• No per-trip breakdowns

====================================
DRIVER EARNINGS LANGUAGE (LOCKED)
====================================

Approved language:
• “Earn up to 80% per trip”
• “Higher trust and consistency unlock higher earnings”

Forbidden language:
• “Drivers get 80%”
• “Platform takes 20%”
• Any wording that implies punishment

====================================
DRIVER APP UI RULES
====================================

Per-trip (cash or card):
• Show ONLY driver earnings
• Show tips clearly
• Do NOT show platform share

Weekly / Monthly:
• Show total earnings
• Show aggregated platform settlement (collapsed by default)

====================================
DRIVER PSYCHOLOGY RULE (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
====================================

• Drivers must feel they earned the money first.
• Platform settlement must feel administrative, not extractive.
• Avoid shock, surprise, or humiliation.
• Never recreate Uber-style resentment patterns.

====================================
BACKEND REQUIREMENTS
====================================

• Platform fee is calculated per trip internally.
• Platform fee is stored securely.
• Cash trips are marked as “driver_collected = true”.
• Platform settlement engine runs asynchronously.
• Failed settlements must NOT block driving immediately.

====================================
FINAL REQUIREMENT
====================================

This rule must be enforced consistently across:
• Payments
• Earnings
• Wallet
• Statements
• Tax documents

Any implementation violating driver dignity is considered a defect.
