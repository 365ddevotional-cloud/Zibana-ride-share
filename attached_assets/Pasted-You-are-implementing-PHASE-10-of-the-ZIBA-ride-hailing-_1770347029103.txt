You are implementing PHASE 10 of the ZIBA ride-hailing app: RIDER & DRIVER TRUST, SAFETY, AND INCIDENT MANAGEMENT.

This phase establishes user confidence, emergency readiness, and post-incident accountability
across all countries and regions.

SAFETY FEATURES MUST WORK EVEN IN EMERGENCY MODE.
NO SAFETY FEATURE MAY BE DISABLED BY PRICING OR INCENTIVES.

=====================================
1) IN-TRIP SAFETY CONTROLS (MANDATORY)
=====================================

Implement the following in-trip safety tools for BOTH riders and drivers:

• SOS / Emergency button (always visible during trip)
• Share Trip feature (live location sharing)
• Trusted contacts list
• Trip details screen (driver/rider identity, vehicle, route)

Rules:
• SOS must be accessible in one tap
• Share Trip must generate a live, expiring link
• Trusted contacts must be configurable by user

=====================================
2) SOS & EMERGENCY HANDLING
=====================================

When SOS is triggered:

• Immediately flag trip as EMERGENCY
• Notify Admin Safety Dashboard
• Capture:
  - user_id
  - trip_id
  - GPS location
  - timestamp
  - device info
• Optionally initiate:
  - emergency call (local emergency number)
  - SMS alert to trusted contacts

Rules:
• SOS must work even if incentives, trips, or payments are paused
• Emergency trips must not be auto-cancelled

=====================================
3) INCIDENT REPORTING (POST-TRIP)
=====================================

Allow riders and drivers to report incidents after trip completion.

Incident types:
• Safety concern
• Harassment
• Payment dispute
• Vehicle issue
• Route deviation
• Other

Required fields:
- incident_id
- reporter_user_id
- trip_id
- incident_type
- description
- attachments (optional)
- created_at
- status (open | reviewing | resolved)

Rules:
• Incidents must be trackable
• Users must see status updates
• Admin actions must be logged

=====================================
4) ADMIN SAFETY & INCIDENT DASHBOARD
=====================================

Admin must be able to:

• View live SOS alerts
• See incident timelines
• Temporarily restrict users during review
• Escalate incidents
• Add internal notes
• Resolve incidents with outcomes

Rules:
• Admin actions must NOT delete trip history
• All safety actions must be audited

=====================================
5) DRIVER & RIDER IDENTITY CONFIDENCE
=====================================

Display verified identity indicators:

Driver:
• Name
• Photo
• Vehicle details
• Verification status

Rider:
• Name
• Rating
• Account age indicator

Rules:
• Verification status must be accurate
• No fake “verified” labels

=====================================
6) BEHAVIORAL TRUST SIGNALS
=====================================

Use trust signals to protect good users:

• High-rated drivers prioritized for vulnerable riders
• Riders with repeated abuse flagged for review
• Trust signals must influence matching subtly, not aggressively

Rules:
• No permanent bans without admin review
• Trust signals decay over time with good behavior

=====================================
7) COUNTRY-SPECIFIC SAFETY CONFIGURATION
=====================================

Allow per-country safety configuration:

• Emergency numbers
• Trusted contact behavior
• Local compliance requirements

Rules:
• Country safety settings must override defaults
• Missing safety config defaults to SAFE MODE

=====================================
8) FAIL-SAFE & OFFLINE BEHAVIOR
=====================================

• SOS button must function even with poor network
• Safety UI must never crash
• If safety backend unreachable:
  - Store incident locally
  - Sync when connection restores

=====================================
9) USER EDUCATION & TRANSPARENCY
=====================================

Integrate Safety explanations into Help Center (Phase 10A):

• How SOS works
• What happens after a report
• How ZIBA protects users
• What is logged and why

Rules:
• Use calm, reassuring language
• No legal intimidation tone

=====================================
10) PHASE COMPLETION CRITERIA
=====================================

Phase 10 is complete only when:

• SOS works reliably
• Trip sharing is live and accurate
• Incidents are trackable end-to-end
• Admin can respond to emergencies
• Users feel protected and informed

This phase is mandatory before large-scale public launch or paid marketing.
