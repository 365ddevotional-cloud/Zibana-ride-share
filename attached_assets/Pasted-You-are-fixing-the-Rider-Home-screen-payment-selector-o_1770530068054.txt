You are fixing the Rider Home screen payment selector
on the ZIBA Rider app.

ISSUE:
The “Cash / Payment” box on the Rider Home screen
is visible but NOT clickable.

GOAL:
Make the payment box fully clickable and route
to a dedicated Payment Selection page,
consistent with ZIBA design and behavior.

DO NOT:
- Break ride request flow
- Auto-change payment method without confirmation
- Expose admin/internal logic
- Create dead-end pages

========================================
PHASE 1 — CLICKABLE PAYMENT CARD
========================================

1) PAYMENT CARD INTERACTION
- Make the entire “Cash / Payment” card clickable
- Cursor/press feedback required
- On tap → navigate to /rider/payment-method

========================================
PHASE 2 — PAYMENT METHOD PAGE
========================================

2) CREATE /rider/payment-method PAGE

This page must include:

A) HEADER
- Title: “Choose Payment Method”
- Back button → returns to Rider Home
- Theme-aware (Light/Dark/Auto)

B) PAYMENT OPTIONS (CARDS)
- Wallet
- Cash
- Sponsored Wallet (if funded by others)
- Future: Card / Bank (disabled with “Coming soon” label)

Each option:
- Clearly selectable
- Shows current status (active / insufficient balance)
- Explains briefly how it works

========================================
PHASE 3 — SELECTION BEHAVIOR
========================================

3) PAYMENT SELECTION LOGIC

When rider selects a method:
- Highlight selection
- Save selection to rider session
- Persist in DB as preferred_payment_method
- Return rider to Home screen
- Update Home payment card text instantly

Example:
“Cash” → “Wallet” or “Sponsored Wallet”

========================================
PHASE 4 — VALIDATION RULES
========================================

4) SAFETY & VALIDATION

- If Wallet selected and balance is low:
  Show warning banner (not blocking):
  “Low balance — you may be asked to top up.”

- If Sponsored Wallet selected:
  - Respect sponsor limits
  - Do not show sponsor identity publicly

- Never auto-switch payment without user action

========================================
PHASE 5 — ZIBRA SUPPORT INTEGRATION
========================================

5) CONTEXTUAL HELP

On Payment Method page:
- Add small “Need help?” link
- Opens ZIBA Support (Z-Assist)
- ZIBRA may explain:
  - Difference between Cash and Wallet
  - Sponsored wallet rules
  - How to top up

ZIBRA must NOT:
- Recommend one method as better
- Promise discounts or refunds

========================================
PHASE 6 — TESTING CHECKLIST
========================================

6) CONFIRM ALL WORKS

- Payment card clickable on Rider Home
- Payment page loads without error
- Selection persists after reload
- Back navigation works
- Ride request uses selected payment
- No console errors
- No impact on Admin/Driver flows

========================================
FINAL CONFIRMATION
========================================

Confirm:
✔ Payment box clickable
✔ Dedicated payment page exists
✔ Smooth navigation
✔ Consistent UI
✔ No broken flows

Proceed safely and confirm completion.
