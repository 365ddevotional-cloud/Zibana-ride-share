ZIBA SYSTEM — CASH TRIP FRAUD CONTROLS + RIDER PAYMENT ONBOARDING

This specification implements:
1) Fraud & abuse prevention for CASH trips
2) Clear rider onboarding education for CASH vs CARD payments

These rules are designed to protect drivers, reduce disputes,
and prevent Uber-style resentment and confusion.

================================================
PART A — FRAUD & ABUSE CONTROLS FOR CASH TRIPS
================================================

OBJECTIVES:
• Prevent fake cash confirmations
• Prevent excessive cash abuse
• Protect drivers from loss
• Protect ZIBA from revenue leakage
• Avoid aggressive enforcement that scares drivers

-----------------------------------------------
CASH TRIP CONFIRMATION RULES
-----------------------------------------------

1. End-of-trip confirmation is REQUIRED for cash trips.
2. Rider must tap:
   “I’ve paid the driver”

3. Driver must confirm:
   “Cash received”

4. Trip is not fully closed until BOTH confirmations occur.

-----------------------------------------------
DISPUTE PROTECTION
-----------------------------------------------

• If rider confirms payment but driver disputes:
  - Flag trip for admin review
  - Temporarily credit driver
  - Freeze rider cash option until resolved

• If driver confirms cash repeatedly but rider disputes:
  - Flag driver for review
  - Do NOT auto-suspend
  - Require admin validation

-----------------------------------------------
ABUSE MONITORING (SOFT RULES)
-----------------------------------------------

Monitor:
• Unusually high ratio of cash trips vs card trips
• Repeated delayed confirmations
• Repeated rider-driver disputes
• Excessive deferred platform settlement balance

-----------------------------------------------
SOFT LIMITS (NO SHOCK ENFORCEMENT)
-----------------------------------------------

• Cap maximum deferred platform balance per driver
• Trigger soft warning:
  “Please settle outstanding balance to continue uninterrupted service.”

• Never block driver mid-trip
• Never display red warning banners
• Escalation requires admin approval

-----------------------------------------------
RIDER CASH ABUSE PREVENTION
-----------------------------------------------

• Riders with repeated “paid but driver says unpaid” disputes:
  - Lose access to cash payment
  - Forced to use card/wallet
  - No public accusation language

-----------------------------------------------
ADMIN CONTROLS
-----------------------------------------------

Admin may:
• Review disputed cash trips
• Reinstate or restrict cash access
• Adjust deferred balances
• Waive balances (logged)

All actions must be auditable.

================================================
PART B — RIDER ONBOARDING EXPLANATION (PAYMENTS)
================================================

OBJECTIVE:
Explain cash vs card clearly, once, without overwhelming the rider.

-----------------------------------------------
FIRST-TIME RIDER PAYMENT INTRO
-----------------------------------------------

“You can pay for trips using a card in the app or by paying the driver in cash.
Choose the option that works best for you.”

Button:
“Got it”

-----------------------------------------------
CASH PAYMENT EXPLANATION
-----------------------------------------------

Title:
“Paying with cash”

Message:
“When you choose cash, you’ll pay the driver directly at the end of the trip.
Please have the correct amount ready.”

-----------------------------------------------
CARD PAYMENT EXPLANATION
-----------------------------------------------

Title:
“Paying with card”

Message:
“When you choose card, payment is handled securely in the app.
You don’t need to exchange cash.”

-----------------------------------------------
IMPORTANT ONBOARDING RULES
-----------------------------------------------

• Show this explanation only:
  - On first app use
  - Or first cash trip
• Allow skip
• Never mention platform fees
• Never compare earnings
• Never mention percentages

-----------------------------------------------
HELP CENTER ENTRY (RIDER)
-----------------------------------------------

Question:
“How do I pay for my trip?”

Answer:
“You can pay with a card in the app or pay the driver directly in cash.
Both options are supported for your convenience.”

================================================
FINAL SYSTEM PRINCIPLE (LOCKED)
================================================

Cash must feel:
• Simple for riders
• Safe for drivers
• Calm for the platform

Any logic that creates confusion, fear, or resentment
is considered a system defect.
