You are activating the “Corporate Rides” and “Special Rides” features
inside the ZIBA Rider Services section.

GOALS:
- Remove “Coming Soon” blockers
- Make all service cards clickable
- Create functional placeholder flows where full rollout is pending
- Keep legal, billing, and role permissions safe
- Maintain visual and UX consistency with ZIBA

================================================
PHASE 1 — SERVICES PAGE CLICKABILITY
================================================

1) SERVICES PAGE FIX

On /rider/services:
- Make ALL service cards clickable:
  ✔ Schedule a Ride
  ✔ Corporate Rides

No disabled or dead cards allowed.

PHASE 2 — CORPORATE RIDES (RIDER)
================================================

2) CORPORATE RIDES ENTRY PAGE

------------------------------------------------

5) PLACEHOLDER MODE (SAFE)

If corporate billing engine is not live:

9) ZIBRA SUPPORT — SERVICES RESPONSES

ZIBRA may say:
- “Corporate Rides allow approved riders to bill trips to a company.”
- “Special Rides offer additional ride options based on availability.”
- “Some services may require approval before use.”

ZIBRA must never say:

================================================

================================================

10) TERMS INSERTION

Show short disclaimers:
