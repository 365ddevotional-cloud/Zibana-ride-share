You are extending the ZIBA Welcome Page into a SMART ONBOARDING & INSIGHT ENTRY POINT.

OBJECTIVE:
Turn the welcome page from a static landing page into:
- a guided onboarding funnel
- a behavior-aware discovery experience
- a data-informed growth surface
WITHOUT forcing sign-up too early.

=====================================================
PHASE 1 — SOFT ONBOARDING FLOW (NO LOGIN REQUIRED)
=====================================================

1) SMART DISCOVERY MODE
When a user clicks any welcome-page card:
- Track which feature they explored
- Store intent temporarily (session-based, anonymous)
Examples:
- clicked “Live Tracking” → intent = safety-aware
- clicked “Flexible Payments” → intent = cost-aware
- clicked “Safety First” → intent = safety-first

2) DELAYED CTA
Do NOT force signup immediately.
Instead:
- Show value first
- Then present “Continue with ZIBA” CTA
CTA text adapts to intent:
- “Track rides safely with ZIBA”
- “Pay flexibly with ZIBA”
- “Ride with verified drivers”

=====================================================
PHASE 2 — ZIBRA INTRO (NO AI MENTION)
=====================================================

3) ZIBRA SOFT INTRO
On second or third interaction:
Show a non-intrusive message bubble:

“Need help choosing how ZIBA works for you?
I can guide you.”

Button:
- “Get guidance” → opens ZIBA Support (public mode)

ZIBRA rules:
- Never mention AI
- Friendly, calm, optional
- No data collection notice needed here

=====================================================
PHASE 3 — SIGNUP CONTEXT PASS-THROUGH
=====================================================

4) INTENT-AWARE SIGNUP
When user finally clicks “Get Started”:
- Pass intent context to signup flow:
  - safety
  - payments
  - speed
  - scheduling
This allows:
- personalized onboarding tips after signup
- better first-session experience

=====================================================
PHASE 4 — LIGHTWEIGHT ANALYTICS (LEGAL SAFE)
=====================================================

5) TRACK ONLY NON-SENSITIVE EVENTS
Track:
- card_click (card_id)
- page_view (public routes only)
- cta_click
- signup_start

DO NOT track:
- personal data
- location
- behavior across accounts
- anything requiring consent banner

6) ADMIN VIEW (READ-ONLY)
Create Admin Insights panel:
- Most-clicked welcome features
- Conversion by feature interest
- Drop-off points

No PII.
No user-level profiling.

=====================================================
PHASE 5 — UX POLISH
=====================================================

7) MICRO-INTERACTIONS
- Hover glow on cards
- Tap ripple on mobile
- Smooth transitions between sections

8) FALLBACK SAFETY
If analytics fails:
- App still works
- No errors shown
- No blocked navigation

=====================================================
PHASE 6 — QA CHECKLIST
=====================================================

Confirm:
✔ Welcome page guides users naturally
✔ Signup feels intentional
✔ ZIBRA appears helpful, not intrusive
✔ No legal exposure
✔ No performance regression
✔ Mobile UX clean

=====================================================
