You are implementing COUNTRY-SPECIFIC TAX COMPLIANCE RULES for the ZIBA platform.
This module governs how tax statements, disclosures, and documents behave per country.

THIS IS A COMPLIANCE LAYER ONLY.
NO UI MARKETING.
NO DAILY DRIVER SURFACING.

==============================
GLOBAL PRINCIPLES (APPLY TO ALL COUNTRIES)
==============================
• Drivers are independent contractors unless explicitly configured otherwise
• ZIBA does not withhold taxes by default
• Platform provides summaries for filing purposes only
• All tax documents are read-only once issued
• Platform fee is shown only in aggregated statements
• Mileage is disclosed only in tax documents

==============================
UNITED STATES (US)
==============================
Document Type:
• IRS Form 1099-NEC

Requirements:
• Report total gross earnings (before platform fees)
• Include total miles driven while online (informational)
• Do NOT deduct platform fees from reportable income
• Show platform fees as aggregated disclosure only
• Mask Tax ID (SSN/EIN) except last 4 digits

Delivery:
• In-app download
• Optional email delivery (admin-controlled)

Compliance Notes:
• ZIBA does not withhold federal or state taxes
• Driver responsible for filing
• Statement language must reference “independent contractor”

==============================
NIGERIA (NG)
==============================
Document Type:
• Annual Earnings Statement

Requirements:
• Show total annual earnings
• Show total miles driven while online (informational)
• Platform fee shown only as aggregated annual value
• No tax withholding shown by default

Compliance Notes:
• Statement is for personal tax filing reference
• ZIBA does not act as tax agent unless configured
• Currency must be NGN

==============================
CANADA (CA)
==============================
Document Type:
• Annual Earnings Statement (T4A-style equivalent if required later)

Requirements:
• Show total gross earnings
• Aggregated platform fees disclosed
• Mileage included for expense calculation support
• Currency must be CAD

Compliance Notes:
• Driver responsible for CRA filing
• No automatic deductions

==============================
GHANA (GH)
==============================
Document Type:
• Annual Earnings Summary

Requirements:
• Total earnings
• Aggregated platform fees
• Mileage disclosure optional but enabled by default

Compliance Notes:
• ZIBA provides records only
• Driver responsible for tax declaration

==============================
OTHER COUNTRIES (DEFAULT RULE)
==============================
If country has no explicit tax form:
• Generate Annual Earnings & Tax Summary
• Include earnings, aggregated platform fees, mileage
• Use local currency
• Use neutral compliance language

==============================
ADMIN CONFIGURATION
==============================
Admin must be able to:
• Enable / disable tax documents per country
• Configure document type per country
• Configure currency per country
• Configure delivery method (in-app / email)

==============================
FAIL-SAFE & LEGAL SAFETY
==============================
• If country tax rules are missing → generate generic annual statement
• Never guess tax withholding
• Never auto-deduct taxes
• Never expose sensitive tax data publicly

==============================
FINAL REQUIREMENT
==============================
Tax compliance must be conservative, configurable, auditable,
and respectful of driver independence across all countries.

Implement exactly as specified.
Confirm when complete.
