You are extending Corporate Rides and Special Rides to include
Admin, Super Admin, and Director-level management.

GOAL:
- Allow Admin / Super Admin to configure Corporate & Special Rides
- Allow Directors to manage eligible drivers under their cells
- Maintain strict role boundaries
- Do NOT expose financial splits or internal commissions to riders or drivers
- Do NOT break existing ride flows

================================================
PHASE 1 — ADMIN CONTROL (SUPER ADMIN & ADMIN)
================================================

1) ADD ADMIN MENU ITEMS
In Admin Dashboard sidebar, add:
- Corporate Rides
- Special Rides

Only visible to:
- Admin
- Super Admin

================================================
PHASE 2 — CORPORATE RIDES (ADMIN SIDE)
================================================

2) CORPORATE RIDES — ADMIN PAGE

Route:
- /admin/corporate-rides

Admin can:
- Create corporate accounts:
  - company_name
  - company_email
  - billing_type (invoice / prepaid wallet / hybrid)
  - monthly_limit (optional)
  - allowed_ride_types
- Assign riders to corporate accounts
- Assign directors to manage corporate drivers (optional)
- Suspend or terminate corporate accounts

Admin CANNOT:
- See driver commissions
- Change ride pricing here

------------------------------------------------

3) CORPORATE RIDES — DIRECTOR VIEW

Directors assigned to a corporate account can:
- View list of assigned corporate drivers
- Monitor ride activity (counts only, no revenue values)
- Flag driver issues
- Recommend drivers for corporate eligibility

Directors CANNOT:
- Create corporate accounts
- Edit billing rules
- See platform earnings

================================================
PHASE 3 — SPECIAL RIDES (ADMIN SIDE)
================================================

4) SPECIAL RIDES — ADMIN PAGE

Route:
- /admin/special-rides

Admin can:
- Enable/disable ride types:
  - Group Rides
  - Event Rides
  - Premium (future)
- Set eligibility rules:
  - driver trust score minimum
  - vehicle requirements
  - city / country availability
- Assign Directors to manage Special Ride pools

================================================
PHASE 4 — SPECIAL RIDES (DIRECTOR ROLE)
================================================

5) DIRECTOR SPECIAL RIDES PANEL

Route:
- /director/special-rides

Directors can:
- See drivers under their cell eligible for special rides
- Recommend drivers for approval
- Temporarily suspend drivers from special rides
- View ride demand indicators (non-financial)

Directors CANNOT:
- Approve final eligibility (Admin only)
- Modify pricing or customer-facing rules

================================================
PHASE 5 — ZIBRA SUPPORT INTEGRATION
================================================

6) ZIBRA CONTEXT AWARENESS

ZIBRA must detect:
- If user is Admin → explain configuration
- If user is Director → explain driver management
- If user is Rider → explain how to request or join

Example:
Director asks: “Why can’t my driver do corporate rides?”
ZIBRA responds with:
- eligibility checklist
- next admin action
- no internal metrics exposed

================================================
PHASE 6 — SAFETY & LEGAL RULES
================================================

7) LEGAL SAFETY
- Corporate & Special Rides are facilitation tools
- ZIBA does not guarantee availability
- Directors act as managers, not employers
- Final authority remains with Admin / Super Admin

================================================
PHASE 7 — TESTING & CONFIRMATION
================================================

8) CONFIRM:
✔ Admin pages load
✔ Director dashboards load
✔ Role isolation enforced
✔ No rider sees admin controls
✔ No pricing leaks
✔ ZIBRA responds correctly per role

Proceed carefully and confirm completion.
