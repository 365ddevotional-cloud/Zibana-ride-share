YOU ARE CONTINUING WORK ON THE ZIBA PLATFORM.

NEXT TASK: EVOLVE ZIBRA INTO A PROACTIVE, VOICE-READY, ROLE-INTELLIGENT SUPPORT & PERFORMANCE SYSTEM.

DO NOT EXPOSE THIS AS “AI”.
DO NOT ADD COMPLEXITY TO USERS.
BUILD IN LAYERS — NOTHING BREAKS IF A LAYER IS DISABLED.

====================================================
PHASE 14 — VOICE-READY ZIBRA (SILENT BY DEFAULT)
====================================================

1) VOICE ARCHITECTURE (FOUNDATION ONLY)
Prepare ZIBRA for voice output without enabling it by default.

Add internal capability:
- text → speech ready
- speech → text ready

Rules:
- Voice OFF by default
- Only enabled later via Settings
- No auto-speaking
- No recording without consent

2) SUPPORTED VOICE LANGUAGES (MATCH UI)
Voice-ready for:
- English
- Yoruba
- Hausa
- Igbo
- French
- Arabic
- Zulu (future)

Fallback:
- If voice unavailable → text only

====================================================
PHASE 15 — PROACTIVE ZIBRA (PREVENT PROBLEMS)
====================================================

3) PROACTIVE SIGNAL ENGINE
ZIBRA must quietly monitor signals and act BEFORE users complain.

Signals include:
- repeated ride cancellations
- wallet low balance patterns
- frequent lost-item reports
- driver idle too long
- director performance decline
- admin approval backlog
- inbox messages unread too long

4) PROACTIVE ACTIONS (ROLE-AWARE)
Rider:
- gentle tips (“Top up to avoid delays”)
- reminders (“You have a scheduled ride tomorrow”)

Driver:
- performance nudges
- safety reminders
- inactivity encouragement

Director:
- cell performance alerts
- driver churn warnings
- commission optimization tips

Admin / Super Admin:
- risk summaries
- backlog warnings
- fraud trend alerts

====================================================
PHASE 16 — DIRECTOR-ONLY ZIBRA COACHING
====================================================

5) DIRECTOR PERFORMANCE MODE
When role = Director:

ZIBRA may:
- summarize driver cell performance
- highlight inactive drivers
- explain commission eligibility rules (NO numbers leaked)
- suggest corrective actions
- remind of contract lifespan and limits
- compare director vs anonymized benchmarks

Rules:
- No other director data shown
- No platform commission formulas exposed
- No driver personal data leaked

====================================================
PHASE 17 — TRUST & DISCIPLINE INTELLIGENCE
====================================================

6) TRUST SCORE ASSISTANCE
ZIBRA may:
- explain why trust score changed (high level)
- suggest recovery actions
- warn before penalties escalate

Never:
- accuse
- threaten
- promise reversals

====================================================
PHASE 18 — HUMAN SUPPORT LOAD REDUCTION
====================================================

7) AUTO-RESOLUTION TARGET
ZIBRA must aim to resolve:
- ≥70% Rider issues
- ≥60% Driver issues
- ≥50% Director issues
without human escalation.

Escalation happens ONLY when:
- safety risk
- legal threat
- repeated failure
- explicit “Contact Human Support”

====================================================
PHASE 19 — SAFETY & LEGAL OVERSIGHT
====================================================

8) LEGAL SAFETY GUARDRAILS
ZIBRA must:
- refuse legal admissions
- redirect lawsuits to policy info
- log sensitive conversations
- escalate risk keywords silently to admins

====================================================
PHASE 20 — METRICS (ADMIN ONLY)
====================================================

9) ZIBRA INSIGHTS DASHBOARD
Admin / Super Admin only:

Track:
- top resolved topics
- escalation rate
- abuse attempts blocked
- director performance deltas
- language usage stats
- notification effectiveness

====================================================
FINAL RULES
====================================================

- ZIBRA never replaces humans — it filters noise
- ZIBRA never guarantees outcomes
- ZIBRA is calm, neutral, professional
- ZIBRA improves platform trust silently

IMPLEMENT FOUNDATION ONLY.
DO NOT ENABLE VOICE OR PROACTIVE PUSH WITHOUT TOGGLES.

CONFIRM COMPLETION WITH:
- New internal modules added
- No UI disruption
- Logs verified
- Roles respected
