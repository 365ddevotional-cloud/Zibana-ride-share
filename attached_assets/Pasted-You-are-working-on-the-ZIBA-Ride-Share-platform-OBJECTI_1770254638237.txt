OBJECTIVE (UI ONLY – NO AUTH CHANGES):
Expose existing Super Admin features (Training, Role Appointments, Admin Management)
inside the Admin Dashboard UI when isSuperAdmin === true.

STRICT RULES (DO NOT VIOLATE):
- DO NOT modify authentication logic
- DO NOT modify role assignment logic
- DO NOT add new roles
- DO NOT reimplement APIs that already exist
- DO NOT create a new app or route root
- DO NOT break Appointed Admin UI
- DO NOT rely on localStorage or client-only flags

AUDIT FIRST (MANDATORY):
1. Confirm the following already exist (do not re-create):
   - isSuperAdmin flag in admin/index.tsx
   - Training section (renamed from Testers)
   - RoleAppointmentsTab
   - AdminManagementTab
   - Backend routes protected by requireSuperAdmin
2. List file locations where these exist.
3. Proceed ONLY if UI exposure is missing.

ROOT CAUSE TO FIX:
Super Admin sections exist but are NOT injected into the Admin navigation menu,
so Super Admin users cannot access them visually.

IMPLEMENTATION TASKS (UI ONLY):

1. Modify the Admin Dashboard navigation builder (admin/index.tsx):
   - Detect isSuperAdmin at render time
   - Dynamically extend the navigation menu ONLY for Super Admins

2. Add a clearly labeled Super Admin section in the Admin Dashboard:
   - Header label: "Super Admin"
   - Icon: shield / lock (reuse existing icon system)

3. Under Super Admin navigation, expose ONLY these items:
   - Training (routes to existing Training component)
   - Role Appointments (routes to RoleAppointmentsTab)
   - Admin Management (routes to AdminManagementTab)

4. Ensure:
   - Appointed Admins NEVER see these items
   - Navigation items are hidden, not disabled
   - No manual URL typing is required to access features

5. Routing behavior:
   - Navigation must link to existing routes
   - Server-side guards remain authoritative
   - UI must not render these sections if isSuperAdmin === false

6. Visual behavior:
   - Super Admin items appear in the same Admin Dashboard
   - No new dashboard shell
   - No duplication of existing menu items
   - Clean, consistent spacing with existing Management Center UI

FINAL SAFETY CHECKS:
- Appointed Admin login:
  ❌ No Training
  ❌ No Roles
  ❌ No Admin Management

- Super Admin login (Preview + Incognito):
  ✅ Sees Training
  ✅ Sees Role Appointments
  ✅ Sees Admin Management

DELIVERABLE:
After implementation, output a concise confirmation report:
- Files touched
- What UI was added
- Why no auth changes were required
- Manual verification steps (Preview + Incognito)

Proceed carefully. Make minimal, surgical UI changes only.
