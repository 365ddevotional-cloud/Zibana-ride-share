PHASE 1 — DRIVER HUB STRUCTURE
Create a Driver Hub with exactly five bottom tabs only: Home, Trips, Earnings, Wallet, Help. No hamburger menu. No hidden tabs.

PHASE 2 — HOME TAB
Display driver photo, name, Trust Score (0–100), driver tier, persistent Online/Offline toggle, today’s summary (trips, earnings, tips, online time), a large primary Go Online / Go Offline button, welcome-back experience for returning drivers, and a system messages preview limited to three items.

PHASE 3 — TRIPS TAB
Show a list of trips with date, time, pickup and drop-off, earnings and tip shown separately, and trip status.
Trip detail view must include route map, distance, duration, full fare breakdown (base, distance, time, tip, platform fee), driver notes, rider trust indicator, and a report trip button.

PHASE 4 — EARNINGS TAB
Show earnings for Today, This Week, and Last 30 Days. Display trips count, average tip, acceptance rate, cancellation rate, and supportive non-punitive insight messages.

PHASE 5 — WALLET TAB
Show available balance, pending balance, withdraw button, transaction history (trips, tips, withdrawals, adjustments). Platform fee must be visible per trip. Tips must never be touched by the platform.

PHASE 6 — HELP TAB
Create a Help Center with categories: Getting Paid, Trips & Ratings, Safety, App Usage, Incentives.
Include a Safety Center with trip recording status, SOS button, report history with status, and ability to submit reports with audio attachment.

PHASE 7 — AUTH & RETURN LOGIC
Implement token-based auto login. Driver stays logged in when app is closed. Login is required only if the driver logs out or deletes the app. Persist authToken, refreshToken, lastLoginAt, and logoutAt.

PHASE 8 — BEHAVIOR & CAUTION SYSTEM
When a driver goes online, analyze acceptance and cancellation trends. Show respectful advisory messages when behavior degrades. No threats. No instant blocking.

PHASE 9 — ADMIN OVERRIDES
Admin can override trust score, reset cancellation metrics, adjust wallet balances, resolve disputes, and remove pairing blocks. Only one override control per driver.

PHASE 10 — ANALYTICS
Track new vs returning drivers, daily active drivers, online time versus earnings, tip frequency, and incentive effectiveness.

Build exactly as specified above. No additional features. Confirm when implementation is complete.
