You are implementing PHASE 6 of the ZIBA ride-hailing app: LAUNCH READINESS & SAFETY KILL-SWITCHES
for Enugu and ALL states in Nigeria.

This phase ensures ZIBA can launch safely, scale state-by-state,
and recover instantly from failures without redeploying the app.

NO FEATURE MAY BYPASS KILL-SWITCHES.

=====================================
1) COUNTRY & STATE LAUNCH CONTROL
=====================================

• Implement country-level launch flags:
  - country_enabled (true/false)

• Implement state-level launch flags for Nigeria:
  - state_code (e.g. EN, LA, AB, PH)
  - state_enabled (true/false)

Rules:
• If country_enabled = false → app blocks trips nationwide
• If state_enabled = false → users can log in but cannot request or accept trips
• State launch must be independently controllable

=====================================
2) DRIVER SUPPLY READINESS GATES
=====================================

Before allowing rider requests in any state:

• Minimum online drivers threshold must be met
• Separate thresholds per vehicle type:
  - cars
  - bikes
  - (keke reserved for future phase)

Rules:
• If threshold not met:
  - Rider sees “Drivers unavailable” message
  - No trips allowed
• Prevents bad first impressions

=====================================
3) WAIT-TIME SAFETY CONTROLS
=====================================

• Track average pickup time per state
• Define max acceptable wait time (configurable)

Rules:
• If wait time exceeds limit:
  - Auto-disable new ride requests
  - Display graceful message to riders
• Drivers remain online

=====================================
4) GLOBAL & MODULE KILL-SWITCHES
=====================================

Admin must be able to instantly disable:

• Trip requests
• Trip acceptance
• Incentives system
• Wallet payouts
• New driver onboarding
• New rider onboarding

Rules:
• Kill-switches must:
  - Take effect immediately
  - NOT require redeploy
  - Be reversible

=====================================
5) INCIDENT RESPONSE MODES
=====================================

Define system modes:
• NORMAL
• LIMITED
• EMERGENCY

Behavior:
• LIMITED:
  - No incentives
  - Reduced matching radius
• EMERGENCY:
  - No new trips
  - Existing trips finish safely

=====================================
6) INCENTIVES VISIBILITY FIX (DUPLICATE REMOVAL)
=====================================

• Incentives module MUST appear ONCE in Admin UI.
• Remove duplicate menu or route registration.
• Enforce single source of truth:
  Management Center → Incentives

DO NOT duplicate incentive controls across admin sections.

=====================================
7) ADMIN DASHBOARD READINESS PANEL
=====================================

Create a Launch Readiness panel showing:
• Country status
• State-by-state enablement
• Online drivers count
• Average pickup time
• Active kill-switches
• Current system mode

=====================================
8) FAIL-SAFE RULES (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
=====================================

• If configuration data is missing → default to SAFE (disabled)
• Kill-switches override incentives, pricing, and matching
• No crash allowed due to missing launch config

=====================================
9) FINAL LAUNCH VALIDATION
=====================================

Phase 6 is complete only when:
• Nigeria can be enabled/disabled centrally
• Each state can launch independently
• Incentives can be paused instantly
• Bad launches can be stopped in seconds
• Duplicate admin modules are removed

This phase MUST be completed before public marketing or driver mass onboarding.
