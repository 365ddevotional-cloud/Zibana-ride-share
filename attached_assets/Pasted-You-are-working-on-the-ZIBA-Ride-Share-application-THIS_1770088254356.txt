You are working on the ZIBA Ride Share application.

THIS PROMPT IS AUTHORITATIVE.
Follow it EXACTLY.
Do NOT suggest alternatives.
Do NOT skip steps.

====================================
GOAL
====================================

Prepare the ZIBA RIDER APP for store submission by ensuring:
• Correct branding
• Proper permissions
• Clear user disclosures
• Store-compliant behavior

NO backend changes.
NO new features.

====================================
PHASE E — STORE READINESS
====================================

1) APP IDENTITY (RIDER-ONLY)

Ensure everywhere in the app:
• App name clearly reads:
  "ZIBA – Rider"

• Remove any text implying:
  - Driver functionality
  - Admin access
  - Multi-role switching

------------------------------------

2) PERMISSIONS HYGIENE

Ensure the app requests ONLY:
• Location (while using app)
• Camera (for profile verification, if used)
• Notifications (optional but explained)

DO NOT:
• Request background location without explanation
• Request contacts, storage, or phone state

Add clear user-facing explanations where permissions are requested.

------------------------------------

3) LOCATION USAGE DISCLOSURE

Before first ride request:
• Show a short explanation:
  "ZIBA uses your location to match you with nearby drivers and calculate fares."

This must be visible BEFORE OS permission prompt.

------------------------------------

4) PAYMENT DISCLOSURE

In /rider/payments or onboarding:
• Clearly state:
  - How payments work
  - Wallet-based charging
  - Test mode (if applicable)

No hidden charges.
No silent deductions.

------------------------------------

5) SAFETY & SUPPORT VISIBILITY

Ensure Rider can easily find:
• Emergency / Safety info
• Support / Help page
• How to report an issue

These must be reachable within 2 taps.

------------------------------------

6) REMOVE DEBUG / TEST LABELS

Ensure:
• No “DEBUG”
• No “DEV MODE”
• No internal labels visible to users

Tester-related text must be user-friendly.

------------------------------------

7) ICONS & METADATA CHECK

Verify:
• App icon is present
• Splash screen is present
• No placeholder images
• No default framework branding

------------------------------------

8) IMPORTANT RESTRICTIONS

DO NOT:
- Change backend
- Change database
- Add analytics SDKs
- Add tracking libraries

This phase is COMPLIANCE & PRESENTATION ONLY.

====================================
EXPECTED RESULT
====================================

• Rider App is store-compliant
• Permissions are justified
• Branding is clear
• No role confusion
• Ready for submission

After completion, respond ONLY with:
“Phase E — Store Readiness complete.”
