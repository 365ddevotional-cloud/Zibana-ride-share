GOAL:
Restore a true SUPER ADMIN system, permanently separate it from Appointed Admin, reintroduce the former “Testers” module as “Training”, and eliminate all delete/session contradictions across browser modes.

CRITICAL RULES:
- AUDIT the codebase first and list what already exists.
- Do NOT re-implement anything already correct.
- Apply changes ONLY where missing or incorrect.
- All authority must be server-side (no client-state trust).

SUPER ADMIN AUTHORITY:
1. Create or confirm a role: SUPER_ADMIN.
2. Bind SUPER_ADMIN strictly to this email:
   mosesafonabi951@gmail.com
3. Enforce server rules:
   - If user.email === "mosesafonabi951@gmail.com" → role MUST be SUPER_ADMIN
   - No UI action can promote any user to SUPER_ADMIN
   - ADMIN users must never access SUPER_ADMIN routes

ROUTING:
4. Create a dedicated protected route:
   /super-admin
5. Deny access unless role === SUPER_ADMIN
6. Keep /admin strictly for Appointed Admin

DASHBOARD SEPARATION:
7. SUPER ADMIN dashboard must include:
   - Training (renamed from Testers)
   - Admin role management
   - System audits
   - Environment status
   - Emergency user cleanup
8. Appointed Admin dashboard must NOT show Training or system tools

TRAINING MODULE:
9. Restore previous Testers logic as “Training”
10. Training users must:
    - Be isolated from production metrics
    - Be flagged as TRAINING
    - Never affect live users
11. Training visibility is SUPER_ADMIN only

DELETE & SESSION CONSISTENCY:
12. Ensure delete behavior is identical across:
    - Normal browser
    - Incognito
    - Admin dashboard
13. All deletes must:
    - Use the same server-side deleteUserAccount()
    - Destroy active sessions
    - Clear auth cookies
    - Invalidate caches
14. Deleted users must never reappear in Admin or Super Admin lists

SAFETY GUARANTEES:
15. No authority via localStorage, memory cache, or client flags
16. All role checks enforced server-side
17. Prevent future contradictions permanently

FINAL STEP:
18. Provide a confirmation report:
    - What existed already
    - What was fixed
    - What was untouched
    - A verification checklist for normal & incognito testing
