You are implementing “Fund Another Wallet” across the ZIBA platform (Rider, Driver, Director).

OBJECTIVE:
Allow any ZIBA user to voluntarily fund another user’s wallet in a safe, non-refundable, legally protected way that increases wallet usage and reduces ride failures.

This is NOT wallet-to-wallet transfer.
This is NOT withdrawal.
Funds can ONLY be used inside ZIBA.

Do NOT break existing wallet logic.
Do NOT change pricing splits or commissions.
