FINAL END-TO-END ZIBA TAX SYSTEM SUMMARY

CORE PHILOSOPHY
Drivers are independent contractors.
ZIBA does not withhold taxes by default.
ZIBA provides accurate records, not tax advice.
Daily driver experience shows only what drivers earn.
Platform fees and tax details are removed from daily workflows.
Transparency exists without damaging driver morale.
