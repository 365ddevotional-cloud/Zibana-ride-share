You are working on the ZIBA Ride Share app.

PROBLEM:
The "Pending Approval" card currently just sets a filter on the Drivers tab.
It does NOT show a proper approval queue (no driver name visible, approve doesn’t visibly update).

GOAL:
When an ADMIN clicks the "Pending Approval" stat card, it must navigate to a dedicated page:
  /admin/approvals
This page must show a real list of pending items (Drivers and Riders) with names and actions.

REQUIREMENTS (DO ALL):

A) NAVIGATION
1) Update the Admin Dashboard "Pending Approval" stat card click to navigate to:
   /admin/approvals
2) Add a Back button (top-left) on that page to return to /admin/dashboard

B) APPROVAL QUEUE UI (NEW PAGE)
Create /admin/approvals page (admin-only) with:
1) Tabs: "Drivers Pending" and "Riders Pending"
2) Each tab displays a table (or list cards) with at least:
   - Full Name (or displayName)
   - Email
   - Phone (if available)
   - Created date
   - Status badge = Pending
   - Actions: Approve, Reject
3) If there are no pending items, show an empty state message.

C) DATA + BACKEND (USE EXISTING STRUCTURE IF PRESENT)
1) Confirm the database has:
   - Driver status field (e.g. PENDING/APPROVED/SUSPENDED) OR isApproved boolean
   - Rider status field (if riders require approval) OR omit riders tab if riders don’t have approval in the schema
2) Build or reuse API endpoints (admin-only):
   - GET /api/admin/approvals?type=driver|rider&status=pending
   - POST /api/admin/approvals/approve  (body: { type, id })
   - POST /api/admin/approvals/reject   (body: { type, id, reason? })
3) These endpoints MUST enforce:
   - user is authenticated
   - user.role is ADMIN or SUPER_ADMIN
   - otherwise return 401/403

D) UX MUST FEEL REAL
1) Approve/Reject must instantly update the page:
   - Remove the approved/rejected user from the pending list (optimistic UI or refetch)
   - Show a toast/snackbar: "Driver approved" / "Driver rejected"
2) After any action, the Admin Dashboard "Pending Approval" count must reflect the new number.
   - Either refetch dashboard metrics
   - or ensure metrics endpoint uses live DB counts.

E) DO NOT
- Do not weaken RBAC
- Do not auto-promote anyone
- Do not approve without showing the user identity
- Do not leave the UI with no visible status change after clicking approve

FINAL RESULT:
Clicking "Pending Approval" takes admin to /admin/approvals,
where they can see each pending driver (name visible), approve/reject,
and the list + counts update immediately.
