TASK: Populate and activate the ZIBA Rider Help Center with proactive content and smart search behavior.

GOAL:
Create a fully populated Help Center for riders that:
1) Shows helpful categories and articles immediately
2) Answers common rider questions clearly
3) Uses intelligent fallback search (closest-match answers)
4) NEVER mentions platform commission, revenue split, or percentage cuts
5) Feels production-ready for Play Store and App Store launch

SCOPE:
RIDER APP ONLY (not simulation mode)

–––––––––––––––––
1. HELP CENTER STRUCTURE
–––––––––––––––––

Create these categories (visible immediately, no empty states):

A. Getting Started
B. Booking a Ride
C. Payments & Wallet
D. Cash Trips
E. Trips & Cancellations
F. Safety & Trust
G. Account & Profile
H. Problems & Support

Remove:
- “No categories available”
- “No featured articles yet”

–––––––––––––––––
2. PRELOAD FAQ ARTICLES (WRITE CONTENT)
–––––––––––––––––

Populate each category with multiple short, clear articles.

EXAMPLES (not exhaustive — add more where reasonable):

GETTING STARTED
- What is ZIBA?
- How do I book my first ride?
- Is ZIBA available in my city?
- How do I create an account?

BOOKING A RIDE
- How do I request a ride?
- How do I change my pickup or drop-off?
- Can I schedule a ride?
- What happens after I request a ride?

PAYMENTS & WALLET
- What payment methods are supported?
- How do I switch payment methods?
- Why is my wallet balance ₦0.00?
- Is card payment secure?

CASH TRIPS
- How does paying with cash work?
- When do I pay the driver?
- What if I don’t have exact cash?
- Can I switch from cash to card?

IMPORTANT:
Never mention:
- Platform fees
- Revenue split
- Percentages taken by ZIBA

TRIPS & CANCELLATIONS
- Can I cancel a ride?
- What happens if a driver cancels?
- Why was my ride canceled?
- What if my driver doesn’t arrive?

SAFETY & TRUST

3. SEARCH BEHAVIOR (VERY IMPORTANT)
–––––––––––––––––

Replace “No results found” behavior.

Implement:
- Fuzzy search / keyword matching
- Synonym matching (e.g., “money”, “pay”, “cash”, “wallet”)
- Closest-article fallback

RULE:
If no exact match exists:
→ Show the MOST RELEVANT article(s)
→ Show a friendly message like:
  “Here’s something that might help.”

NEVER show:
- Empty search results
- Dead-end screens

–––––––––––––––––
4. UX RULES
–––––––––––––––––

- Articles open instantly
- Back button always works
- No blocked buttons
- Mobile-friendly scrolling
- Clear, calm language (non-technical)

–––––––––––––––––
5. ADMIN / CONTENT RULE
–––––––––––––––––

- Content is static for now (no CMS needed yet)
- Future updates can be added later
- No simulation references
- No internal business logic exposed

–––––––––––––––––
6. FINAL CHECK
–––––––––––––––––

Confirm before finishing:
- Categories display correctly
- Articles open and read well
- Search never returns “no results”
- No mention of platform cut or commission
- Suitable for Play Store & App Store review

Then mark task complete.
