You are working on the ZIBA Ride Share app (Rider, Driver, Admin).

GOAL: Fix scheduled rides persistence + implement cancellation fees + add rider inbox, notifications, automated in-app marketing + FIX Saved Places (Home/Work) so they are clickable, save correctly, and display on the Rider Home screen. Do NOT change pricing splits or platform commission visibility.

====================================
0️⃣ FIX: SAVED PLACES (HOME / WORK) NOT CLICKABLE
====================================

BUG:
- On Rider Home screen, “Home – Add home address” and “Work – Add work address” are not clickable.
- They must open a form, allow saving, then return to the previous screen and display the saved address.

REQUIRED UX:
- Tap “Home” row → navigates to SavedPlaceForm(type="home")
- Tap “Work” row → navigates to SavedPlaceForm(type="work")
- Form fields:
  - Label (auto: Home/Work, non-editable)
  - Address text (required)
  - Optional: Notes (gate code / landmark)
  - Optional: Latitude/Longitude if map/search exists (fallback to text only if not)
  - Save button (enabled only when address is not empty)
- On save:
  - Persist to DB (or user profile table) tied to rider_id
  - Navigate back to Rider Home
  - Home/Work rows now show the saved address summary (truncate nicely)
- Add Edit:
  - If already saved, tapping Home/Work opens the same form pre-filled with existing value (update not duplicate)

BACKEND REQUIREMENTS:
- Add/confirm DB storage:
  Option A (recommended): saved_places table
    - id, rider_id, type ENUM('home','work'), address, notes, lat, lng, updated_at, created_at
    - UNIQUE (rider_id, type)
  Option B: rider_profile fields (home_address, work_address, etc.) if already present

- Provide APIs:
  GET  /me/saved-places
  PUT  /me/saved-places/home
  PUT  /me/saved-places/work
(or a single endpoint PUT /me/saved-places {type, address, notes, lat, lng})

FRONTEND REQUIREMENTS:
- Ensure the Saved Places rows are real buttons (not blocked by overlay / pointer-events).
- Add onClick handlers to navigate.
- After save, refresh rider profile/saved places state so it renders immediately (optimistic update is fine).

VALIDATION:
- From Rider Home → tap Home → enter address → Save → back → Home now shows address
- Same for Work
- Edit existing address works
- No page reload required

====================================
1️⃣ FIX: Scheduled Ride Not Appearing
====================================

BUG:
- Rider can successfully schedule a ride
- Confirmation screen shows success
- Clicking “View Scheduled Rides” navigates correctly
- BUT scheduled ride does NOT appear in the Scheduled tab

REQUIRED FIX:
- Ensure scheduled rides are saved persistently in the database with:
  - ride_type = "scheduled"
  - status = "scheduled"
  - scheduled_at (datetime)
  - pickup_location
  - dropoff_location
  - rider_id
  - payment_method
- Ensure backend returns scheduled rides when querying:
  GET /rides?type=scheduled&user=rider
- Ensure frontend Scheduled tab uses this API and renders results
- Ensure newly scheduled ride appears immediately without refresh
- Add fallback empty-state ONLY if zero scheduled rides exist

VALIDATION:
- Schedule ride → confirmation → view scheduled rides → ride appears

====================================
2️⃣ CANCELLATION FEE + PENALTY LOGIC
====================================

RULES (Nigeria launch):
- Rider can cancel FREE within 3 minutes AFTER driver accepts
- If rider cancels AFTER 3 minutes and driver is en route:
  - Apply fixed cancellation fee (configurable via admin)
  - Deduct from wallet (preferred) or mark as pending if cash
- If scheduled ride is canceled within 30 minutes of pickup:
  - Apply scheduled cancellation penalty
- Repeated cancellations reduce rider trust score

IMPLEMENT:
- Server-side enforcement (no frontend-only logic)
- Admin-configurable values:
  - cancellation_fee_amount
  - scheduled_penalty_amount
  - grace_period_minutes
- Clear rider-facing messages before confirming cancellation

====================================
3️⃣ RIDER MESSAGE INBOX
====================================

ADD:
- In-app inbox for riders (non-SMS)
- Message types:
  - Trip updates
  - Payment alerts
  - Cancellation notices
  - Promotions
  - System announcements
- Messages stored in DB and visible in Help / Inbox tab
- Support team can view rider messages in Admin

====================================
4️⃣ NOTIFICATION PERMISSIONS
====================================

IMPLEMENT:
- Prompt rider for notification permission on first login
- Notification triggers:
  - Driver assigned
  - Driver arriving
  - Ride scheduled confirmation
  - Cancellation penalties
  - Wallet low balance
- Store notification preferences per user

====================================
5️⃣ STRATEGIC IN-APP MARKETING (NON-INTRUSIVE)
====================================

ADD automated messages such as:
- “Schedule rides in advance and avoid delays”
- “Low balance — top up your wallet to avoid ride issues”
- “Reliable drivers available in your area now”
- “Cash rides available — wallet gives priority matching”

RULES:
- No spam
- Max 1 marketing message per 24 hours
- Disable during active trip

====================================
6️⃣ ADMIN & DRIVER VISIBILITY
====================================

ADMIN DASHBOARD:
- View all scheduled rides
- Filter by date, city, status
- See cancellation penalties applied
- Configure cancellation fee values

DRIVER SIDE:
- Drivers can see upcoming scheduled rides
- Drivers receive notification before pickup time
- Drivers can accept scheduled rides

====================================
7️⃣ FINAL CHECKLIST
====================================

✔ Saved Places Home/Work are clickable
✔ Home/Work save + return + display works (and edit works)
✔ Scheduled rides persist and display correctly
✔ Cancellation fees enforced server-side
✔ Rider inbox functional
✔ Notifications permission implemented
✔ Marketing messages live but controlled
✔ Admin controls configurable
✔ No exposure of platform commission or splits

Proceed carefully, test end-to-end, and confirm each section works before marking complete.
