STOP. DO NOT ADD NEW FEATURES BEYOND WHAT IS SPECIFIED.

You are fixing the existing Tester Management system in the ZIBA Ride Share app.

GOALS (ALL MUST BE COMPLETED):

1) FIX USER SELECTION BUG (CRITICAL)
- In both “Add Rider Tester” and “Add Driver Tester” modals:
  - Selecting a user MUST correctly update the selected value.
  - The dropdown must be a fully controlled component.
  - The selected user must be stored as `selectedUserId`.
  - The “Add Tester” button MUST remain disabled until a valid user is selected.
  - Clicking any email MUST persist and not revert to the default user.

2) DISPLAY EMAIL INSTEAD OF NUMERIC USER ID
- In Tester Management table:
  - Replace numeric `userId` display with:
    - User email (primary)
    - User full name (secondary, if available)
  - Numeric IDs may remain internally but must NEVER be shown in UI.

3) SEPARATE WALLETS (IMPORTANT)
Each tester must have:
- Main Wallet (real wallet – ₦0.00 for testers)
- Tester Wallet (test credits only)

Rules:
- Tester Wallet is used ONLY for test rides.
- Main Wallet remains unchanged.
- Payment checks must prioritize Tester Wallet when `isTester = true`.

4) FIX TEST CREDIT TOP-UP NOT REFLECTING
- Ensure tester wallet balance updates immediately:
  - Backend: persist to `testerWalletBalance`
  - Frontend: refetch wallet after top-up
- The rider’s Payments & Wallet page MUST show:
  - Main Wallet
  - Tester Wallet
  - Clear labels (e.g. “Test Credits”)

5) SUPER ADMIN CONTROLS ONLY
Only Super Admin can:
- Add Rider Tester
- Add Driver Tester
- Top up tester credits
- Refund tester credits

Refund rules:
- Refunds affect ONLY Tester Wallet
- No interaction with real wallet or payments
- Log all actions (top-up & refund) as TEST transactions

6) DEFAULT TESTER CREDIT
- When a tester is added:
  - Automatically credit ₦45,000 to Tester Wallet
  - Log transaction as “INITIAL_TEST_CREDIT”

7) ADD DRIVER TESTER = SAME FIX
- Apply ALL above fixes identically to:
  - Add Driver Tester
  - Driver Tester Wallet
  - Driver Tester top-ups & refunds

8) DO NOT ADD DIRECTOR TESTER
- Explicitly DO NOT create Director Tester.
- Directors do not require wallets or ride simulation.
- This avoids unnecessary complexity and cost.

9) COST CONTROL (IMPORTANT)
- Reuse existing tables where possible.
- If needed, add ONLY:
  - `testerWalletBalance`
  - `isTester`
  - `testerType` (RIDER | DRIVER)
- No new payment gateways.
- No background jobs.
- No external services.

10) FINAL VERIFICATION
After implementation, confirm:
- Selecting smefas37@gmail.com works
- “Add Tester” becomes clickable
- ₦45,000 appears in Tester Wallet
- Top-ups reflect instantly on rider/driver device
- Email is shown everywhere instead of numeric ID

DO NOT ASK QUESTIONS.
IMPLEMENT DIRECTLY.
