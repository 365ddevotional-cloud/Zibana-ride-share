YOU ARE WORKING ON THE ZIBA RIDER APP.
GOAL: FINALIZE AND ACTIVATE ALL RIDER FLOWS WITH ZERO DEAD TAPS, ZERO “COMING SOON”, AND FULL NAVIGATION CONSISTENCY.

DO NOT REMOVE OR BREAK EXISTING LOGIC.
AUDIT FIRST, THEN FIX ONLY WHAT IS MISSING OR DISABLED.

====================================================
PHASE 0 — QUICK AUDIT (DO NOT SKIP)
====================================================

1) Scan Rider UI for:
- Disabled cards
- Non-clickable containers
- “Coming Soon” labels
- Missing routes
- Missing back navigation

2) Identify components involved:
- Services cards
- Payment card
- Account list items
- Corporate Rides
- Special Rides

====================================================
PHASE 1 — ACTIVATE CORPORATE & SPECIAL RIDES
====================================================

A) REMOVE ALL “COMING SOON” STATES
- Corporate Rides
- Special Rides

B) MAKE BOTH FULLY CLICKABLE
Services screen:
- Tapping Corporate Rides → /rider/corporate
- Tapping Special Rides → /rider/special

C) CREATE MINIMAL FUNCTIONAL PAGES IF MISSING

/rider/corporate:
- Title: Corporate Rides
- Description: Ride on your company’s account with centralized billing
- CTA:
  - “Request Corporate Ride”
  - If user not enrolled → show info + contact/admin flow
- Back button → Services

/rider/special:
- Title: Special Rides
- Options:
  - Premium Ride
  - Group Ride
  - Event Ride
- Each option opens placeholder detail page (no dead taps)
- Back button → Services

NO FEATURE SHOULD LEAD TO A BLANK PAGE.

====================================================
PHASE 2 — FIX RIDER HOME PAYMENT CARD
====================================================

1) Make payment box clickable:
- Cash / Wallet card → /rider/payment-method

/rider/payment-method page:
- Select Cash
- Select Wallet
- Wallet balance display
- Link: “Top up wallet”
- Back button → Home

2) “Payment help” card:
- Route to /rider/help
- Open ZIBA Support (Z-Assist)

====================================================
PHASE 3 — ACCOUNT TAB: MAKE EVERYTHING CLICKABLE
====================================================

ALL account rows must navigate properly:

Profile → /account/profile
Email → /account/email
Phone → /account/phone
Saved Places → /account/saved-places
Notifications → /account/notifications
Marketing → /account/marketing
Data Usage → /account/data-usage
Ride History → /activity
Trusted Contacts → /account/trusted-contacts
Ride PIN → /account/ride-pin
Emergency → /account/emergency
Help Center → /help

EACH PAGE MUST:
- Have a visible Back button
- Return to Account tab
- Never crash on empty data

====================================================
PHASE 4 — SERVICES TAB FINAL PASS
====================================================

Services screen must contain:
- Schedule Ride (working)
- Corporate Rides (ACTIVE, clickable)
- Special Rides (ACTIVE, clickable)

NO disabled UI.
NO “Coming Soon”.
NO dead arrows.

====================================================
PHASE 5 — UX & CONSISTENCY RULES
====================================================

- Entire card is tappable (not icon-only)
- Arrow icon reflects navigation
- Consistent header styling
- Back navigation always works
- Empty states show guidance, not errors

====================================================
PHASE 6 — FINAL QA CHECKS (REQUIRED)
====================================================

Test manually:
- Tap every card
- Navigate forward and back
- Refresh page
- Test logged-in Rider only

Confirm:
- No console errors
- No blank screens
- No disabled interactions

====================================================
FINAL INSTRUCTION
====================================================

DO NOT LEAVE ANY RIDER-FACING UI NON-CLICKABLE.
IF A FEATURE EXISTS VISUALLY, IT MUST NAVIGATE.
MATCH ALL STYLING WITH EXISTING ZIBA DESIGN SYSTEM.

IMPLEMENT NOW AND CONFIRM:
- Which routes were added
- Which components were updated
- What was already working vs fixed
