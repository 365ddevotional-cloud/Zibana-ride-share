You are finalizing Rider-side Payments UX and introducing controlled third-party wallet funding
inside the ZIBA platform.

GOALS:
- Remove all dead payment UI
- Make every payment-related card clickable
- Introduce “Fund Another User” safely
- Keep platform legally protected
- Do NOT expose internal commissions or balances

================================================
PHASE 1 — PAYMENT CARD CLICKABILITY (RIDER HOME)
================================================

1) PAYMENT METHOD CARD FIX

On Rider Home:
- Make the “Cash” / “Payment” card clickable

Route:
- /rider/payments

No disabled or dead cards allowed.

================================================
PHASE 2 — PAYMENTS OVERVIEW PAGE
================================================

2) PAYMENTS OVERVIEW PAGE

Route:
- /rider/payments

Sections:
- Current payment method (Cash / Wallet)
- Wallet balance
- Auto top-up status
- Payment help
- Fund another user (NEW)

Buttons:
- Switch payment method
- Manage wallet
- Fund another user
- Payment help

================================================
PHASE 3 — FUND ANOTHER USER (RIDER → RIDER)
================================================

3) FUND ANOTHER USER ENTRY

Route:
- /rider/payments/fund-user

Purpose:
Allow one user to add funds to another user’s wallet.

Use cases:
- Parent → child
- Spouse → spouse
- Employer → staff
- Friend → friend

------------------------------------------------

4) FUNDING RULES (STRICT)

- Funder must be a verified ZIBA user
- Recipient must be an existing ZIBA user
- Funding is wallet-only (no cash)
- Funds are non-refundable once transferred
- ZIBA is not responsible for disputes between users

------------------------------------------------

5) FUNDING FLOW

Steps:
1. Enter recipient email or phone
2. System validates recipient
3. Enter amount
4. Confirm funding
5. Show success receipt

Receipt includes:
- Amount
- Date/time
- Recipient masked ID
- Transaction ID

================================================
PHASE 4 — DIRECTOR FUNDING DRIVERS (CONTROLLED)
================================================

6) DIRECTOR FUNDING ENTRY (PRIVATE)

Route:
- /director/wallet/fund-driver

Rules:
- Director can fund ONLY drivers assigned to their cell
- Funds go to driver wallet
- Funds can be restricted to ride usage (optional flag)
- Admin/Super Admin can view all transactions

------------------------------------------------

7) DIRECTOR FUNDING LIMITS

- Daily funding cap (admin-configurable)
- Abuse detection:
  - repeated funding to inactive drivers
  - circular funding patterns
- ZIBRA flags anomalies to Admin

================================================
PHASE 5 — ZIBRA SUPPORT RESPONSES
================================================

8) ZIBRA RESPONSE RULES (PAYMENTS)

ZIBRA may say:
- “ZIBA allows users to support others by funding wallets.”
- “Once funds are transferred, they are not reversible.”
- “ZIBA facilitates wallet transfers but does not mediate personal disputes.”

ZIBRA must never say:
- “We can reverse this”
- “We guarantee refund”
- “ZIBA is responsible for misuse”

================================================
PHASE 6 — LEGAL PROTECTION
================================================

9) TERMS INSERTION (LIGHT)

Show acknowledgment before funding:
“Wallet transfers are voluntary. ZIBA facilitates transfers but is not responsible for agreements between users.”

Must be accepted before completion.
