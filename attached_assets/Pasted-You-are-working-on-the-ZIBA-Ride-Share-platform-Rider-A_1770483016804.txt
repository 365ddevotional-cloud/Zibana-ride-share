You are working on the ZIBA Ride Share platform (Rider App, Driver App, Admin Dashboard).

CRITICAL GOAL:
Make ZIBA legally robust across ALL user touchpoints (riders, drivers, staff, partners, government-facing interactions), eliminating liability loopholes related to lost items, accidents, theft, injuries, or third-party actions — while still offering helpful safety features.

Additionally, design a branded AI-powered support intelligence to reduce human support load, without explicitly labeling it as “AI”.

DO NOT break existing functionality.
Audit what already exists first.
Add only what is missing.

==================================================
PHASE 1 — PLATFORM-WIDE LEGAL PROTECTION STRATEGY
==================================================

1) UNIVERSAL ASSUMPTION OF RISK CLAUSE
Add a core legal principle enforced platform-wide:

- Riders, drivers, and all users agree that:
  - ZIBA is a technology platform, NOT a transportation provider
  - All trips are undertaken at the user’s own risk
  - ZIBA does not own vehicles, employ drivers, or control trip outcomes

This clause must be:
- Accepted at signup (mandatory checkbox)
- Referenced in Terms & Conditions
- Reinforced contextually (not aggressively) inside the app

==================================================
PHASE 2 — LOST ITEM LEGAL SAFEGUARDS
==================================================

2) LOST ITEM DISCLAIMER (MANDATORY ACCEPTANCE)
Before a lost-item report can be submitted, show a short acknowledgement:

“ZIBA helps facilitate communication but does not guarantee recovery of lost items. Drivers are not obligated to return items. ZIBA is not responsible for loss, damage, or recovery outcomes.”

Require user to tap:
[ I Understand & Agree ]

3) TERMS CLARIFICATION
Add explicit wording:
- ZIBA is not liable for:
  - Lost, damaged, or stolen personal property
  - Failure to recover items
  - Driver or rider actions regarding items
- Lost item rewards are goodwill gestures, not obligations
- Safe Return Hubs are facilitation tools, not custody guarantees

==================================================
PHASE 3 — ACCIDENT, ROBBERY & SAFETY LIABILITY SHIELD
==================================================

4) ACCIDENT & CRIME DISCLAIMER
Add clauses stating:
- ZIBA does not guarantee rider or driver safety
- ZIBA is not liable for:
  - Accidents
  - Injuries
  - Assault
  - Robbery
  - Property damage
- Drivers and riders are responsible for personal safety decisions

5) INCIDENT REPORT PURPOSE LIMITATION
Clarify that:
- Accident and incident reporting is for documentation and assistance ONLY
- Reports do not imply fault, liability, or compensation
- Any insurance or relief funds are discretionary and conditional

==================================================
PHASE 4 — DRIVER & RIDER AGREEMENTS
==================================================

6) DRIVER AGREEMENT ADDITIONS
- Drivers are independent contractors
- Drivers control acceptance, routes, and conduct
- ZIBA does not supervise trips
- Lost item handling is voluntary
- Unsafe behavior or fraud may lead to deactivation

7) RIDER AGREEMENT ADDITIONS
- Riders are responsible for belongings
- Riders must exercise caution and judgment
- False reports or abuse may lead to suspension

==================================================
PHASE 5 — STRATEGIC IN-APP LEGAL PLACEMENT
==================================================

8) WHERE TO PLACE DISCLAIMERS (NON-INTRUSIVE)
Strategically surface legal reminders at:
- Signup (full acceptance)
- Lost-item submission
- Accident report submission
- Safety center
- Help center articles
- Periodic app updates (“We’ve updated our Terms”)

DO NOT show disclaimers on every screen.
DO NOT overwhelm users.

==================================================
PHASE 6 — GOVERNMENT & PARTNER SAFEGUARDS
==================================================

9) PLATFORM POSITIONING
Ensure all documentation, metadata, and descriptions state:
- “ZIBA is a digital marketplace”
- “ZIBA does not provide transportation services”
- “ZIBA does not employ drivers”

This protects against:
- Labor classification issues
- Government liability claims
- Regulatory overreach

==================================================
PHASE 7 — AI SUPPORT INTELLIGENCE (BRANDED, QUIET)
==================================================

10) INTRODUCE A BRANDED SUPPORT INTELLIGENCE
Create an in-app assistant named something neutral and friendly, e.g.:

- “ZIBA Guide”
- “Z-Assist”
- “ZIBA Care”
- “Zee”

RULES:
- Do NOT call it “AI”
- Present it as “ZIBA Support”
- Friendly, calm, informative tone

11) CAPABILITIES
ZIBA Support should:
- Answer FAQs
- Explain app features
- Guide payments, rides, safety, lost items
- Help users troubleshoot issues
- Escalate to human support ONLY when needed

12) LEGAL AWARE RESPONSES
Ensure ZIBA Support:
- Never admits fault
- Never promises compensation
- Always frames assistance as facilitation
- Uses phrases like:
  “ZIBA helps connect…”
  “We recommend…”
  “Based on your situation…”

==================================================
PHASE 8 — DATA & AUDIT PROTECTION
==================================================

13) LOGGING & AUDIT
- Log all reports, chats, and acknowledgements
- Time-stamp agreement acceptance
- Make logs accessible to Admin
- Ensure legal traceability

==================================================
FINAL CONSTRAINTS
==================================================

- No liability guarantees
- No promises of recovery
- No implied employment
- No fault admission
- No compensation obligation unless explicitly approved by Admin

ZIBA must remain:
✔ Helpful
✔ Safety-conscious
✔ Legally insulated
✔ Scalable
✔ Government-safe
✔ Partner-safe

Proceed carefully, validate each addition, and confirm nothing breaks.
