You are working on the ZIBA Ride Share app.

ROLE HIERARCHY (STRICT — DO NOT ALTER):
1) SUPER_ADMIN — absolute authority
2) ADMIN — limited operational authority
3) DRIVER / RIDER / USER — standard roles

ONLY SUPER_ADMIN has full access to every part of the ZIBA Ride Share system.

CURRENT BEHAVIOR (MUST REMAIN ENFORCED):
- /admin routes are protected
- Only ADMIN or SUPER_ADMIN may access /admin/*
- Public users are always redirected to /welcome
- RBAC checks are server-side and enforced
- Initial SUPER_ADMIN is the seeded 365ddevotional account

GOAL:
Implement a SECURE, TIME-BOUND, SCOPE-LIMITED ADMIN APPOINTMENT SYSTEM
controlled ONLY by SUPER_ADMIN.

────────────────────────
REQUIRED FEATURES (DO ALL)
────────────────────────

1) USER MODEL
Confirm the User model includes:
- role: USER | DRIVER | ADMIN | SUPER_ADMIN

Extend admin governance with:
- adminStartAt (Date | null)
- adminEndAt (Date | null)
- adminPermissions (JSON / string array / enum-based scope)

2) SUPER_ADMIN-ONLY ADMIN APPOINTMENT
Create a SUPER_ADMIN-only mechanism to appoint admins.

This MUST:
- Require authenticated SUPER_ADMIN session
- Never be exposed publicly
- Never be client-controlled
- Never auto-promote users
- Never promote by email domain

SUPER_ADMIN defines:
- WHO becomes ADMIN
- WHEN the admin role starts
- WHEN it expires
- WHAT the admin is allowed to do

3) ADMIN PERMISSION SCOPES (LIMITED POWERS)
Admins may ONLY operate within assigned scopes, such as:
- DRIVER_MANAGEMENT
- RIDER_MANAGEMENT
- TRIP_MONITORING
- DISPUTES
- REPORTS (read-only if defined)

Admins CANNOT:
- Appoint other admins
- Change roles
- Access SUPER_ADMIN tools
- Modify pricing, commissions, or system rules
- Override RBAC
- Access system secrets

SUPER_ADMIN can access ALL scopes without restriction.

4) TIME-BOUND ADMIN ENFORCEMENT
Admin access MUST be automatically revoked when:
- Current date > adminEndAt

On expiration:
- Role immediately downgraded to USER
- Admin session invalidated
- User must re-login
- Redirect to /welcome

NO manual cleanup required.

5) LOGIN & REDIRECTION RULES
On successful login:
- SUPER_ADMIN → /admin/dashboard
- ADMIN (valid & active) → /admin/dashboard
- Expired / unauthorized → /welcome

Users must log out and log back in for role changes to take effect.

6) HARD SECURITY RULES (ABSOLUTE)
DO NOT:
- Allow ADMIN to appoint other admins
- Allow unlimited admin duration
- Allow role assignment from frontend
- Remove role guards
- Expose admin routes publicly
- Allow bypass of admin expiration
- Modify authentication logic

7) FINAL SYSTEM GUARANTEE
- SUPER_ADMIN has absolute authority over:
  - Roles
  - Admin duration
  - Admin duties
  - All system areas
- ADMIN authority is temporary, scoped, and revocable
- ZIBA remains secure, scalable, and enterprise-ready

Implement the solution completely.
Do not explain.
Do not weaken security.
