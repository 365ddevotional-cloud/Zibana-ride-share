You are working on the ZIBA Ride Share app.

OBJECTIVE

Implement a mature, eye-safe theme system with:

Neutral Light mode (NOT pure white)

Dark mode for night use

Automatic switching based on system/time

Manual override by the user (especially drivers)

This must be production-safe, non-breaking, and future-proof.

REQUIREMENTS (DO ALL)
1️⃣ Create a centralized Theme System

Define Light Theme and Dark Theme tokens

Replace hardcoded white backgrounds

Apply theme globally across:

Admin Dashboard

Driver views

Rider views

Cards remain slightly elevated from background

Light Theme (Day):

App background: soft neutral gray (NOT white)

Card background: off-white

Text: deep charcoal (not pure black)

Dark Theme (Night):

App background: deep slate / blue-charcoal

Card background: slightly lighter dark panel

Text: soft off-white

Do NOT use pure black or pure white.

2️⃣ Add Theme Preference to User Settings

For Drivers (and other users) add:

Profile → Settings → Appearance

Theme Preference:

☀️ Light

🌙 Dark

🕒 System (Auto)

Store preference per user in the database.

3️⃣ Implement Auto (System) Mode

Default preference = System

If System:

Follow device / browser color scheme

Respect night/day automatically

If user selects Light or Dark:

Override system behavior completely

4️⃣ Persistence Rules

Theme choice must persist across:

Logout / login

Page refresh

Use existing auth/session system

Do NOT introduce breaking changes

5️⃣ UX & Safety Constraints (VERY IMPORTANT)

DO NOT:

Add new auth logic

Break existing layouts

Change role permissions

Affect routing

Introduce flashing or high-contrast colors

Ensure:

Smooth transitions

Calm visuals

Driver eye comfort for long usage

FINAL RESULT (MUST VERIFY)

App no longer uses white background

Dark mode activates automatically at night

Driver can override dark mode manually

UI looks calm, professional, and enterprise-grade

No regressions in Admin, Driver, or Rider flows

Implement completely and safely.
