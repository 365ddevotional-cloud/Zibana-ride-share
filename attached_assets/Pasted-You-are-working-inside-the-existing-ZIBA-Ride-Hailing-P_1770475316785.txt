You are working inside the existing ZIBA Ride-Hailing Platform
(Rider App, Driver App, Admin Dashboard).

⚠️ CRITICAL RULES:
- DO NOT delete or refactor existing logic unless strictly necessary
- DO NOT break payments, wallets, ratings, trips, or authentication
- FIRST audit what already exists
- ONLY add what is missing
- If something partially exists, extend it
- All changes must be backward-compatible

====================================================
PHASE 0 — SYSTEM AUDIT (MANDATORY)
====================================================

Before adding anything, perform a READ-ONLY audit:

Check if the following already exist (fully or partially):
- Accident reporting flows
- Lost item reporting flows
- Admin moderation dashboards
- Wallet fee logic
- Trust / rating logic
- Notifications / inbox system
- Safety flags
- Insurance references

Create an internal checklist:
- ✅ Exists (do nothing)
- 🟡 Partial (extend safely)
- ❌ Missing (add cleanly)

ONLY proceed to implementation after this audit.

====================================================
PHASE 1 — INSURANCE PARTNER INTEGRATION
====================================================

GOAL:
Add insurance support WITHOUT embedding ZIBA into liability.

IMPLEMENT (ONLY IF MISSING):

Admin → Safety → Insurance Partners
- Add insurance partner profiles:
  - Company name
  - Coverage type (driver / rider / vehicle)
  - Contact API or manual claim URL
  - Active regions

Accident Flow Enhancement:
- If accident severity = Moderate or Serious:
  - Show “Insurance Support Available”
  - Provide partner contact or claim link
  - Log insurance referral (no data auto-sharing)

RULE:
- ZIBA never auto-files claims
- Rider/Driver explicitly opt-in

====================================================
PHASE 2 — DRIVER ACCIDENT RELIEF FUND
====================================================

GOAL:
Support drivers financially without touching base fare logic.

IMPLEMENT:

Admin → Finance → Driver Relief Fund
- Configurable fund pool
- Funding sources:
  - % of cancellation fees
  - % of lost item fees
  - Admin top-ups

Driver Eligibility:
- Accident verified
- Driver not at fault OR shared fault
- Minimum trust score threshold

Driver App:
- “Accident Support Available”
- Show:
  - Approved amount
  - Status
  - Expected payout date

Payout:
- Wallet credit
- Clearly labeled “Relief Fund Credit”

====================================================
PHASE 3 — AI FRAUD DETECTION (LOST ITEMS)
====================================================

GOAL:
Stop abuse while protecting honest drivers.

IMPLEMENT SILENTLY (NO USER UI):

Signals to Track:
- Rider reports lost item frequently
- Same item type repeated
- Driver frequently accused but items not found
- GPS + time mismatch
- No proof uploads

Risk Scoring:
- Low → no action
- Medium → require extra verification
- High → manual admin review

Admin Dashboard:
- “Fraud Risk” tag
- Pattern visualization
- Manual override tools

RULE:
- Never auto-ban
- Never auto-accuse

====================================================
PHASE 4 — TRUST SCORE IMPACT LOGIC
====================================================

GOAL:
Make trust scores meaningful but fair.

EXTEND EXISTING RATING SYSTEM (DO NOT REPLACE):

Inputs:
- Ride ratings
- Cancellation behavior
- Accident honesty
- Lost item cooperation
- Fraud flags (low weight)

Outputs:
- Trust Score (0–100)
- Visibility tier
- Feature access priority

Effects:
- Higher trust = priority matching
- Lower trust = warnings first, not punishment

Admin:
- Manual adjustment allowed
- Full audit trail required

====================================================
PHASE 5 — VISUAL UI WIREFRAMES (NON-BINDING)
====================================================

GOAL:
Design reference UI without forcing frontend refactor.

CREATE:
- Wireframes (concept-level) for:
  - Safety Hub
  - Lost Item Flow
  - Accident Flow
  - Driver Relief Fund
  - Admin Safety Panel

RULES:
- Match existing ZIBA visual language
- Improve clarity, spacing, font size
- Do NOT hard-code styles yet
- Mark as “Design Reference Only”

====================================================
PHASE 6 — SYSTEM SAFETY CHECK
====================================================

Before finalizing:

✔ Payments still work
✔ Wallet logic unchanged
✔ Trips unaffected
✔ Ratings intact
✔ Notifications unaffected
✔ Admin access preserved

If any risk is detected:
- Roll back ONLY that module
- Log issue clearly

====================================================
FINAL INSTRUCTION
====================================================

Proceed carefully.
Audit first.
Add only missing components.
Extend, never replace.
Preserve platform stability.
Log all changes.

Confirm completion with a summary of:
- What existed
- What was extended
- What was newly added
