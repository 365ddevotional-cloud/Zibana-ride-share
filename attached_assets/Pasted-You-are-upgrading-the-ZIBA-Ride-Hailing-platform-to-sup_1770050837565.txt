You are upgrading the ZIBA Ride-Hailing platform to support FULL Nigeria bank integrations for driver withdrawals, with strict identity verification, currency consistency, and fraud protection.

THIS IS A BLOCKING STEP. IMPLEMENT COMPLETELY.

GOALS (DO NOT SKIP ANY):

1) NIGERIA BANK WITHDRAWAL INTEGRATION
- Enable driver withdrawals to Nigerian bank accounts only.
- Supported payout currency: NGN ONLY.
- No USD, no cross-currency, no conversion.
- Wallet currency, ride fare currency, payout currency MUST ALL MATCH (NGN).

2) DRIVER BANK ACCOUNT MODEL
Create or extend a driverBankAccounts model with:
- driverId
- bankName
- bankCode
- accountNumber
- accountName
- countryCode = "NG"
- isVerified (boolean)
- createdAt

Rules:
- One bank account per driver.
- One bank account cannot be reused by multiple drivers.
- Bank account must be verified before withdrawals are allowed.

3) IDENTITY & RESIDENCE VERIFICATION (NIGERIA)
Driver MUST have ALL of the following verified before withdrawal:
- Government ID (Nigeria-specific)
- Residential address (must match ID)
- NIN (Nigeria National Identification Number)
- Valid Driver’s License

Store verification flags server-side:
- isIdentityVerified
- isAddressVerified
- isNINVerified
- isDriversLicenseVerified

If ANY is false → block withdrawals.

4) WITHDRAWAL RULES & SAFETY
- Only VERIFIED drivers can withdraw.
- Test drivers CANNOT withdraw real funds.
- Minimum withdrawal amount (Nigeria): ₦1,000
- Withdrawals only from EARNINGS WALLET (not test wallet).
- Suspended drivers are blocked from withdrawals and from going online.

5) DRIVER WITHDRAWALS SYSTEM
Create a driverWithdrawals table with:
- driverId
- amount
- currencyCode = NGN
- status (PENDING | APPROVED | REJECTED | PAID)
- bankAccountId
- requestedAt
- processedAt
- processedByAdminId

All withdrawal logic MUST be server-side enforced.

6) REVENUE SPLIT ENFORCEMENT
Enforce revenue split at trip completion:
- 80% → Driver earnings wallet
- 20% → ZIBA commission wallet

NO hard-coded values.
NO rounding errors.
Totals must reconcile exactly.

7) ADMIN CONTROLS
Admin must be able to:
- View all driver bank accounts
- Approve or reject withdrawal requests
- View full audit trail
- See country-specific rules enforced

8) FRAUD PREVENTION
- Block multiple drivers sharing the same NIN.
- Block multiple drivers sharing the same bank account.
- Log all violations.

9) UI / UX REQUIREMENTS
- Driver dashboard must show:
  - Linked bank account
  - Verification status checklist
  - Withdrawal eligibility status
- Withdrawal button must be DISABLED until all requirements are met.

10) DOCUMENTATION
- Update replit.md with:
  - Nigeria withdrawal flow
  - Verification requirements
  - Revenue split rules
  - Fraud safeguards

IMPORTANT CONSTRAINTS:
- DO NOT provide sample data.
- DO NOT remove existing features.
- DO NOT explain the implementation.
- DO NOT ask questions.
- IMPLEMENT AND ENFORCE SERVER-SIDE.

This upgrade must be production-grade, secure, and irreversible.
