You are working on the ZIBA Ride Share app.
Your task is to separate the RIDER APP from the existing unified app
WITHOUT touching the backend APIs or production database.

STRICT RULES:
- DO NOT modify database schemas
- DO NOT add or remove migrations
- DO NOT change backend endpoints
- Frontend-only separation
- Use role-based access enforcement
- App must be Google Play compliant for a Rider-only app

PHASE A — APP MODE SETUP
1. Introduce a global application mode flag:
   APP_MODE = "RIDER"

2. Ensure this flag is accessible across routing, auth guards, and UI rendering.

PHASE B — AUTH & ROLE ENFORCEMENT
3. Enforce a hard restriction:
   - Only users with role === "RIDER" may log in
   - If any other role (DRIVER, ADMIN, DIRECTOR, TRIP_COORDINATOR) attempts login:
     → Immediately log them out and show an access error

4. This restriction must apply at:
   - Login
   - Session restore
   - Route navigation

PHASE C — ROUTE & SCREEN ISOLATION
5. Completely disable and unregister ALL driver-related routes:
   - Driver dashboard
   - Driver onboarding
   - Driver navigation
   - Driver earnings
   - Driver accept/decline rides
   - Driver withdrawals
   - Any /driver/* routes

6. Do NOT merely hide UI components.
   Routes must not exist in Rider App builds.

PHASE D — RIDER-ONLY FEATURES (KEEP ENABLED)
7. Ensure the Rider App supports ONLY:
   - Rider registration & login
   - Request ride
   - Ride tracking
   - Ride history
   - Rider wallet & payments
   - Ratings (rider → driver)
   - Support & SOS
   - Rider profile & settings

PHASE E — UI & COPY CLEANUP
8. Remove ALL driver language from the UI:
   - No references to “earn”, “drive”, “accept trips”
   - App wording must be rider-focused only

PHASE F — APP IDENTITY
9. Prepare the app for Rider-only distribution:
   - App Name: “ZIBA Ride”
   - Package Name: com.ziba.rider
   - Ensure no driver permissions are requested

PHASE G — SAFETY CHECK
10. Verify:
   - Driver users cannot log in
   - No driver routes are reachable
   - App functions correctly using existing production data
   - No backend changes were required

Proceed step-by-step.
Explain each change briefly as you implement it.
Do NOT move to Driver App separation.
Focus ONLY on Rider App separation.
