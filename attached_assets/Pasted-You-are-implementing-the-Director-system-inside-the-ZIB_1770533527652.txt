You are implementing the Director system inside the ZIBA platform.

Director Types:
1) Contract Director
2) Employee Director

GOAL:
- Create a dedicated Director Dashboard
- Enforce lifecycle rules, caps, and permissions
- Enable driver cell management
- Integrate ZIBRA oversight
- Maintain Admin / Super Admin supremacy
- Do NOT expose platform commission figures to drivers or riders

================================================
PHASE 1 — DIRECTOR APPOINTMENT & LIFECYCLE
================================================

1) DIRECTOR APPOINTMENT (SUPER ADMIN)

Route:
- /admin/directors/appointments

Super Admin can:
- Appoint Director (Contract or Employee)
- Set:
  - director_type
  - start_date
  - end_date (lifespan)
  - max_cells (default: 3)
  - commission_rate (default 12%, adjustable)
  - status (active / suspended / terminated)

Admin may:
- View director records
- Recommend actions

Only Super Admin can:
- Appoint
- Terminate
- Extend lifespan
- Change commission rate

================================================
PHASE 2 — DRIVER CELLS & HARD CAPS
================================================

2) DRIVER CELL RULES (ENFORCED SERVER-SIDE)

Per Director:
- Max active drivers per cell: 1300
- Max commissionable drivers per cell per day: 1000
- Commissionable pool per day = 77% of drivers who worked that day (capped at 1000)

Rules:
- Director earns commission ONLY from what ZIBA earns
- Drivers beyond commissionable cap → no commission impact
- Caps configurable only by Super Admin

================================================
PHASE 3 — DIRECTOR DASHBOARD (PRIVATE)
================================================

3) DIRECTOR DASHBOARD CORE

Route:
- /director/dashboard

Visible ONLY to:
- Director
- Admin
- Super Admin

Sections:
- Overview (cells, active drivers, today’s active drivers)
- Driver Cells
- Driver Status (active / suspended)
- Performance Metrics (non-financial)
- Staff Management
- Notifications
- ZIBRA Insights

================================================
PHASE 4 — DRIVER MANAGEMENT (DIRECTOR)
================================================

4) DRIVER MANAGEMENT POWERS

Directors can:
- Activate drivers who signed up with their referral code
- Suspend drivers (temporary)
- Flag drivers for Admin review
- Monitor driver compliance

Directors CANNOT:
- Permanently deactivate drivers
- Change driver payouts
- Modify platform rules

================================================
PHASE 5 — DIRECTOR STAFF & PERMISSIONS
================================================

5) DIRECTOR STAFF SYSTEM

Directors can:
- Create staff accounts
- Assign staff to specific dashboard sections:
  - Driver monitoring
  - Reports
  - Compliance
- Discipline staff (within limits)

Rules:
- Staff see ONLY their permitted sections
- Staff actions logged with identity
- Admin / Super Admin can see all staff activity

================================================
PHASE 6 — COMMISSION VISIBILITY (STRICT)
================================================

6) COMMISSION DISPLAY RULES

Director Dashboard shows:
- Eligible drivers count
- Commissionable drivers count
- Commission percentage (not raw amounts unless approved)

Never show:
- Platform revenue totals
- Per-driver earnings
- Internal cost structures

================================================
PHASE 7 — ZIBRA OVERSIGHT (DIRECTORS)
================================================

7) ZIBRA PERFORMANCE COACHING

ZIBRA must:
- Review director performance patterns
- Prompt directors:
  - “Your driver activation rate is low”
  - “High suspension frequency detected”
- Suggest best practices
- Flag risky behavior to Admin

ZIBRA must NOT:
- Threaten
- Promise earnings
- Override Admin authority

================================================
PHASE 8 — AUDIT & SECURITY
================================================

8) FULL AUDIT TRAIL

Log:
- Director actions
- Staff actions
- Driver activations/suspensions
- ZIBRA prompts

Every action includes:
- Who
- When
- What
- From which dashboard

================================================
PHASE 9 — TESTING
================================================

9) CONFIRM:
✔ Director Dashboard loads
✔ Appointment flow works
✔ Lifespan enforced
✔ Driver caps enforced
✔ Staff permissions isolated
✔ ZIBRA prompts visible
✔ Admin/Super Admin override intact

Proceed step-by-step and confirm completion.
