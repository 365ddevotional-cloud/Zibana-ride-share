PHASE 4 – PRE-LAUNCH CLEAN MODE + CLICK RESTORE

We are officially in PRE-LAUNCH MODE.
ZIBA has NOT launched.
All fake seeded metrics must be removed immediately.

========================================
PART 1 – REMOVE ALL DUMMY NUMBERS
========================================

Across ALL admin sections:

- Trips
- Reservations
- Ride Classes
- Finance & Wallets
- Ratings & Support
- Safety & Compliance
- Growth & Intelligence

Remove ALL hardcoded numeric stats.

Replace with:

const isPreLaunch = true;

If isPreLaunch:
- Show all KPI cards as 0
- Replace large numbers with "—"
- Replace currency with "₦0"
- Show banner at top:

"Platform Status: PRE-LAUNCH
No operational data available yet.
Metrics will populate after go-live."

Tables must display:
Empty state component with:

"No data available.
ZIBA operations have not started."

Do NOT seed mock trips, mock wallets, mock ratings, or mock revenue.

Remove any fake ₦ amounts or fabricated statistics.

========================================
PART 2 – MAKE ALL TRAINING CENTER BUTTONS CLICKABLE
========================================

Under:

/admin/users/training-center

Every "View Materials" button must route to:

/admin/users/training-center/:slug

Create these routes:

- driver-onboarding
- safety-protocols
- app-navigation
- customer-service
- earnings-payouts

Each page must include:

- Proper header
- Structured content
- Relevant bullet points
- Back button to Training Center

No page should be blank.
No dead ends.

========================================
PART 3 – VALIDATE ALL SIDEBAR SECTIONS
========================================

Ensure ALL subgroups under:

Trips & Operations
Finance & Wallets
Ratings & Support
Safety & Compliance
Growth & Intelligence

Are:

- Clickable
- Route to correct page
- Have content
- Have back navigation to parent
- No redirect loops to dashboard

========================================
PART 4 – FINAL CHECK
========================================

- No fake metrics
- No hardcoded numbers
- No placeholder lorem text
- No dead routes
- No console errors

This is a CLEAN PRE-LAUNCH admin.
We are stabilizing, not adding new features.

Proceed.
