You are implementing the Director Payouts & Release System across the ZIBA platform.

OBJECTIVE:
Design a secure, auditable, abuse-resistant payout workflow for Directors
(Contract & Employee) that preserves platform control, prevents disputes,
and maintains legal protection.

This system must:
- Respect director commission caps and eligibility rules
- Prevent automatic or guaranteed payouts
- Allow Admin and Super Admin full control
- Integrate ZIBRA monitoring and alerts
- Never expose platform revenue or commission math

Do NOT break existing payout systems.
Do NOT auto-release funds.
Do NOT guarantee payout timing or amounts.

=====================================================
DIRECTOR PAYOUT FUNDAMENTALS
=====================================================

1) PAYOUT SOURCE
Director payouts are derived ONLY from:
- Platform earnings generated by eligible drivers under the director
- Eligibility rules already enforced:
  - Minimum drivers activated
  - Daily commissionable driver cap
  - 77% active-driver rule
  - Cell limits
  - Compliance status

Director never sees:
- Total platform revenue
- Individual driver earnings
- Commission calculation formula

=====================================================
DIRECTOR PAYOUT STATES
=====================================================

Each payout record must have one state:

- Calculating
- Pending Review
- Approved
- Scheduled
- Released
- Held
- Reversed

State transitions are ADMIN / SUPER ADMIN controlled.

=====================================================
PAYOUT SCHEDULE LOGIC
=====================================================

Admin-configurable payout cadence:
- Daily (summary only, no release)
- Weekly
- Bi-weekly
- Monthly

Defaults:
- Contract Director: Monthly
- Employee Director: As configured internally

Directors see:
- Estimated earnings (non-final)
- Status only (Pending / Under Review / Released)

=====================================================
DIRECTOR PAYOUT DASHBOARD
=====================================================

Director View:
- Estimated Earnings (masked)
- Payout Status
- Last Payout Date
- Notices (holds, reviews)

Director CANNOT:
- Request early payout
- Edit payout method
- See driver-level contributions
- Override holds

Admin / Super Admin View:
- Full payout breakdown
- Driver eligibility counts
- Flags and anomalies
- Override controls

=====================================================
ADMIN PAYOUT REVIEW CONTROLS
=====================================================

Admin Actions:
- Approve payout
- Hold payout
- Partially release
- Reverse payout (pre-release)
- Attach internal notes

Super Admin Actions:
- Force release
- Force hold
- Adjust commission percentage
- Adjust caps
- Terminate director payouts entirely

All actions require:
- Reason field (mandatory)
- Actor signature
- Timestamp

=====================================================
ZIBRA PAYOUT MONITORING
=====================================================

ZIBRA must continuously evaluate:
- Sudden spikes
- Drop-offs
- Driver churn vs earnings
- Repeated disputes
- Referral abuse patterns

ZIBRA may:
- Flag payouts for review
- Recommend holding payouts
- Notify Admin/Super Admin

ZIBRA must NOT:
- Release payouts
- Change payout amounts
- Communicate payout promises to directors

=====================================================
HOLDS, REVERSALS & DISPUTES
=====================================================

Automatic Hold Triggers:
- Fraud flags
- Excessive driver suspensions
- Lost-item abuse patterns
- Driver complaints against director
- Compliance breaches

Director Notification (neutral language):
"Your payout is currently under review due to compliance checks.
No action is required at this time."

Dispute handling:
- Directors may submit explanation
- Admin reviews
- Final decision by Super Admin

=====================================================
LEGAL & TERMS SAFETY
=====================================================

Director-facing payout disclaimer:

"Director earnings are estimates based on platform activity and subject to
eligibility rules, caps, compliance reviews, and administrative approval.
ZIBA does not guarantee earnings, payout timing, or amounts."

No UI text may imply:
- Guaranteed income
- Automatic payouts
- Employment relationship

=====================================================
AUDIT & LOGGING (MANDATORY)
=====================================================

Log fields:
- payout_id
- director_id
- cell_id
- period_start / period_end
- eligibility_snapshot
- payout_state
- actor_id
- actor_role
- action_taken
- timestamp

Logs visible to:
- Admin
- Super Admin
- Compliance

Logs immutable after release.

=====================================================
DELIVERABLE CONFIRMATION
=====================================================

Confirm after implementation:
- Payout states work end-to-end
- No auto-release exists
- Director UI is read-only for payouts
- Admin and Super Admin controls function
- ZIBRA flags integrate correctly
- Audit logs complete

Proceed step-by-step and confirm completion.
