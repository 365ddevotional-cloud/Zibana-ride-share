You are FIXING and ACTIVATING existing Rider features in the ZIBA app.
This is NOT a new feature build — it is activation, routing, and UI repair.

OBJECTIVE:
- Remove all “Coming Soon” states for Corporate Rides and Special Rides
- Make them fully clickable and functional
- Ensure Rider Account boxes are clickable
- Route users to real pages (existing or newly created placeholders)
- Maintain ZIBA design, legal posture, and permissions

DO NOT:
- Change pricing logic
- Change driver payouts
- Expose admin-only data
- Add new business rules

====================================================
PHASE 1 — REMOVE “COMING SOON” FEATURE FLAGS
====================================================

1) CORPORATE RIDES
- Remove `comingSoon = true` or equivalent feature flag
- Enable click interaction on:
  - Services → Corporate Rides
  - Rider Account → Corporate Rides (if listed)

2) SPECIAL RIDES
- Remove `comingSoon = true`
- Enable click interaction on:
  - Services → Special Rides
  - Rider Account → Special Rides (if listed)

These features are now ACTIVE, not hidden.

====================================================
PHASE 2 — ROUTING (NO DEAD LINKS)
====================================================

3) CORPORATE RIDES ROUTE
Create or activate route:
- /rider/corporate-rides

Page content:
- Title: Corporate Rides
- Description: Ride on your company’s account with centralized billing
- Sections:
  - Request Corporate Ride
  - Join a Company
  - Company Wallet / Invoices (read-only for now)
  - Contact Corporate Admin
- CTA buttons must be clickable (even if actions are placeholders)

4) SPECIAL RIDES ROUTE
Create or activate route:
- /rider/special-rides

Page content:
- Title: Special Rides
- Ride types:
  - Premium Ride
  - Group Ride
  - Event Ride
- Each option clickable → routes to:
  - /rider/special-rides/premium
  - /rider/special-rides/group
  - /rider/special-rides/event

If logic is not implemented yet:
- Show “Available soon” INSIDE page
- Do NOT block navigation
- Do NOT show “Coming Soon” on Services page anymore

====================================================
PHASE 3 — SERVICES PAGE FIX
====================================================

5) SERVICES PAGE UI
On /rider/services:
- Corporate Rides card:
  - Fully clickable
  - Remove disabled styling
  - Remove “Coming Soon” badge
- Special Rides card:
  - Fully clickable
  - Remove disabled styling
  - Remove “Coming Soon” badge

Cards must behave like “Schedule a Ride”.

====================================================
PHASE 4 — RIDER ACCOUNT CLICKABILITY FIX
====================================================

6) RIDER ACCOUNT PAGE
On /rider/account:
- Make ALL boxes clickable:
  - Profile
  - Email
  - Phone
  - Saved Places
  - Notifications
  - Marketing
  - Data Usage
  - Ride History
  - Trusted Contacts
  - Ride PIN
  - Emergency
  - Help Center

Each must route to its relevant page.

7) BACK NAVIGATION
Every destination page must include:
- Page title
- Back arrow → returns to Rider Account
- No dead ends

====================================================
PHASE 5 — CONSISTENCY & UX
====================================================

8) UI CONSISTENCY
- Corporate & Special Rides pages must:
  - Match ZIBA dark theme
  - Use same typography scale as Welcome page
  - Use standard card and button styles

====================================================
PHASE 6 — SAFETY & LEGAL
====================================================

9) LEGAL LANGUAGE (PASSIVE)
On Corporate & Special Ride pages, include soft footer text:
“ZIBA facilitates ride access. Availability and eligibility may vary.”

No guarantees.
No promises.
No liability language.

====================================================
PHASE 7 — FINAL VERIFICATION
====================================================

10) CONFIRM ALL:
✔ Corporate Rides clickable
✔ Special Rides clickable
✔ No “Coming Soon” labels remain
✔ Rider Account boxes clickable
✔ All routes load without error
✔ Back navigation works everywhere
✔ UI consistent with ZIBA brand

This is an ACTIVATION & FIX task — not a redesign.
Proceed carefully and confirm completion.
