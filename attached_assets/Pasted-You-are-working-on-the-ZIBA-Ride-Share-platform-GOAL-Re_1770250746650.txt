You are working on the ZIBA Ride Share platform.

GOAL:
Restore full SUPER ADMIN capabilities inside the existing Admin Dashboard,
including role assignment and the former “Testers” module renamed to “Training”,
WITHOUT creating a new app, new login flow, or new frontend route.

ABSOLUTE RULES (NON-NEGOTIABLE):
- DO NOT create a fourth app or fourth separation.
- DO NOT create a new /super-admin frontend route.
- SUPER ADMIN lives inside /admin and is revealed by role-based visibility only.
- Server-side authority is the single source of truth.

AUDIT FIRST:
1. Audit the entire codebase and explicitly list:
   - Existing roles
   - Existing role middleware
   - Existing admin feature flags
   - Existing tester/training logic
2. DO NOT reimplement anything that already exists.
3. Modify ONLY what is missing, disabled, or incorrectly gated.

SUPER ADMIN AUTHORITY (SERVER-SIDE):
4. Confirm role: SUPER_ADMIN already exists.
5. Bind SUPER_ADMIN strictly to this email:
   mosesafonabi951@gmail.com
6. Enforce on the server:
   - If user.email === "mosesafonabi951@gmail.com", role MUST be SUPER_ADMIN.
   - No UI action may promote any user to SUPER_ADMIN.
   - Appointed Admins must NEVER gain SUPER_ADMIN privileges.

ADMIN DASHBOARD VISIBILITY (CRITICAL FIX):
7. Keep a single Admin route:
   /admin
8. Implement role-based UI rendering:
   - If role === SUPER_ADMIN:
       Show Super Admin sections
   - If role === ADMIN:
       Hide Super Admin sections entirely
9. This must be enforced by server-validated role data, not client state.

SUPER ADMIN SECTIONS (RESTORE):
10. Restore and mount these sections inside Admin Dashboard
    ONLY when role === SUPER_ADMIN:
    - Training (renamed from Testers)
    - Admin Role Assignment
    - System Audits
    - Environment / Health Status
    - Emergency User Cleanup
11. Appointed Admin UI must remain unchanged and must NOT see Training.

TRAINING MODULE (FORMER TESTERS):
12. Restore previous Testers logic as “Training”.
13. Training users must:
    - Be clearly flagged as TRAINING
    - Be isolated from production analytics, payouts, and metrics
    - Never affect live riders, drivers, or revenue
14. Training visibility and controls must be SUPER_ADMIN ONLY.

DELETE CONSISTENCY (LOCK IT PERMANENTLY):
15. Ensure ALL user deletion paths use the SAME server-side function:
    deleteUserAccount()
16. Deletes must:
    - Remove database records
    - Destroy sessions
    - Clear auth cookies
    - Invalidate caches
    - Prevent ghost users from reappearing
17. Admin lists must re-fetch directly from the database after delete.

SECURITY GUARANTEES:
18. No client-side storage (localStorage, memory, cache) may grant authority.
19. All role checks must be server-side and authoritative.
20. Behavior must be identical in:
    - Normal browser
    - Incognito
    - Fresh sessions

FINAL REQUIREMENT:
21. Provide a confirmation report with:
    - What already existed
    - What was added
    - What was only re-enabled or re-gated
    - What was intentionally left untouched
    - A step-by-step verification checklist
