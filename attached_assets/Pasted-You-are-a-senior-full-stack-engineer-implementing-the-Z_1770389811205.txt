You are a senior full-stack engineer implementing the ZIBA Driver Hub system.
Build everything EXACTLY as specified below. Do not add features. Do not change wording.

==============================
PHASE 1 — DRIVER HUB STRUCTURE
==============================
Create a Driver Hub with exactly five bottom tabs:
Home, Trips, Earnings, Wallet, Help.
No hamburger menu. No hidden navigation.

==============================
PHASE 2 — HOME TAB
==============================
Display driver photo, name, Trust Score (0–100), driver tier, persistent Online/Offline toggle,
today’s summary (trips, earnings, tips, online time),
a large primary Go Online / Go Offline button,
welcome-back screen for returning drivers,
and system messages preview limited to three items.

==============================
PHASE 3 — TRIPS TAB
==============================
Show trip list with date, time, pickup and drop-off, driver earnings only, tip shown separately, and status.

Trip detail view must include:
route map, distance, duration,
fare total earned by driver (no platform fee),
driver private notes, rider trust indicator,
and report trip button.

==============================
PHASE 4 — EARNINGS TAB
==============================
Show earnings for Today, This Week, and Last 30 Days.
Display trips count, average tip, acceptance rate, cancellation rate,
and supportive non-punitive insight messages.

==============================
PHASE 5 — WALLET TAB
==============================
Show available balance, pending balance, withdraw button, transaction history.
Transaction history shows trip earnings, tips, withdrawals, adjustments.
Platform fee must NOT appear here.

==============================
PHASE 6 — HELP TAB
==============================
Help Center categories:
Getting Paid, Trips & Ratings, Safety, App Usage, Incentives.

Safety Center includes:
trip recording status, SOS button, report history with status,
submit report with audio attachment.

==============================
PHASE 7 — AUTH & RETURN LOGIC
==============================
Implement token-based auto login.
Driver stays logged in when app is closed.
Require login only if driver logs out or deletes app.
Persist authToken, refreshToken, lastLoginAt, logoutAt.

==============================
PHASE 8 — BEHAVIOR & CAUTION SYSTEM
==============================
When driver goes online, analyze acceptance and cancellation trends.
Show respectful advisory messages only.
No threats. No instant blocking.

==============================
PHASE 9 — ADMIN OVERRIDES
==============================
Admin can override trust score, reset cancellation metrics,
adjust wallet balances, resolve disputes,
and remove pairing blocks.
Single override control per driver.

==============================
PHASE 10 — ANALYTICS
==============================
Track new vs returning drivers, daily active drivers,
online time versus earnings, tip frequency, incentive effectiveness.

====================================================
PLATFORM FEE VISIBILITY — GLOBAL CORRECTION (LOCKED)
====================================================
Platform fee must NEVER be shown to riders.
Platform fee must NOT be shown to drivers per trip.
Per-trip views show ONLY what the driver earned (fare + tip).

Platform fee may ONLY be shown to drivers in:
monthly statements,
quarterly statements (if applicable),
annual tax documents (1099 or country equivalent).

Platform fee must be aggregated totals only.
No per-trip platform fee breakdown.
Platform fee is calculated internally but hidden from daily UI.

====================================================
MONTHLY STATEMENT WIREFRAME
====================================================
Monthly statement screen shows:
driver identity,
statement month,
total driver earnings (trips + tips + incentives),
activity summary (trips, online hours),
collapsed section for total platform fee (aggregated),
net payout summary,
download PDF / CSV buttons.

Platform fee is collapsed by default and never itemized per trip.

====================================================
YEARLY STATEMENT / TAX WIREFRAME
====================================================
Yearly statement shows:
driver identity,
tax year,
total gross earnings,
aggregated annual platform fee (required for tax),
reportable income,
downloadable tax documents.

No daily resurfacing of platform fee.

====================================================
FINAL RULES
====================================================
Daily driver experience must focus on earnings only.
Platform earnings must never be repeatedly surfaced.
Driver morale and trust take priority.
Build exactly as specified and confirm when complete.
