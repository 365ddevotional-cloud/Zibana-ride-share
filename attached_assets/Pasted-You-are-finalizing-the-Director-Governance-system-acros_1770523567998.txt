You are finalizing the Director Governance system across the ZIBA platform.

OBJECTIVE:
Implement Director fraud detection, conflict resolution, termination handling,
and wind-down procedures in a legally safe, auditable, non-disruptive manner.

This applies to:
- Contract Directors
- Employee Directors

Admin and Super Admin retain final authority.

Do NOT break existing Director dashboards.
Do NOT expose platform revenue or commission math.
Do NOT delete historical data.
Do NOT auto-punish without Admin/Super Admin review.

=====================================================
PART K — DIRECTOR FRAUD & ABUSE DETECTION
=====================================================

FRAUD SIGNALS TO MONITOR:
- Artificial driver activation patterns
- Repeated short online sessions to inflate activity
- Coordinated driver cancellations
- Forced driver behavior (coercion reports)
- Excessive funding used as leverage
- Abnormal referral clustering
- Repeated payout spikes followed by churn

SYSTEM RESPONSE LEVELS:
Level 1 — Soft Flag
- ZIBRA notifies Admin silently
- Director receives neutral compliance reminder

Level 2 — Review Hold
- Director payouts placed on hold
- Director informed neutrally
- Admin investigation required

Level 3 — Enforcement
- Suspension or termination (Admin / Super Admin only)
- Funding disabled
- Drivers reassigned if needed

ZIBRA MUST NOT:
- Accuse
- Threaten
- Promise outcomes

=====================================================
PART L — DIRECTOR–ADMIN CONFLICT RESOLUTION
=====================================================

CONFLICT TYPES:
- Director disputes payout hold
- Director disputes suspension
- Director disputes driver reassignment
- Director disputes staff restriction

CONFLICT FLOW:
1) Director submits dispute (structured form)
2) Admin reviews evidence
3) ZIBRA summarizes case (neutral)
4) Super Admin issues final decision

UI REQUIREMENTS:
- Dispute status tracking
- Message history
- Evidence attachments (optional)
- Read-only once closed

LANGUAGE:
Neutral, facilitative, non-legal.

=====================================================
PART M — DIRECTOR TERMINATION & WIND-DOWN
=====================================================

TERMINATION TRIGGERS:
- Contract expiration
- Repeated compliance failure
- Fraud confirmation
- Admin/Super Admin decision

TERMINATION PROCESS:
1) Director status → Terminated
2) Director dashboard → Read-only
3) Funding disabled
4) Staff access revoked
5) Drivers reassigned or unassigned
6) Pending payouts resolved or held
7) Audit record sealed

IMPORTANT:
- Termination does NOT delete history
- Director cannot reactivate themselves
- Super Admin override required for reinstatement

=====================================================
PART N — DRIVER PROTECTION DURING TERMINATION
=====================================================

When Director is terminated:
- Drivers remain active
- Drivers notified neutrally:
  “Your director assignment has changed.”
- No earnings impact
- No driver penalties

Admin decides:
- Reassignment to new Director
- Direct platform management

=====================================================
PART O — DATA RETENTION & LEGAL SAFETY
=====================================================

DATA RETENTION:
- Director records retained permanently
- Payout records immutable
- Audit logs immutable
- Staff actions preserved

LEGAL SAFETY LANGUAGE (TERMINATION VIEW):
“Director appointments are facilitation roles subject to review, suspension,
or termination at ZIBA’s discretion. No guarantees of continuation are provided.”

=====================================================
PART P — FINAL DIRECTOR SYSTEM VALIDATION
=====================================================

Confirm ALL:
✔ Fraud signals detected
✔ No auto-punishment
✔ Admin/Super Admin authority intact
✔ Director disputes handled
✔ Wind-down safe for drivers
✔ Data preserved
✔ ZIBRA guidance active

Proceed step-by-step.
Do not mark complete until all scenarios pass.
