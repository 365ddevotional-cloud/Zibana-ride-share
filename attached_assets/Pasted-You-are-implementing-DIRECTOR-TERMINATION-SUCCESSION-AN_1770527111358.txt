You are implementing DIRECTOR TERMINATION, SUCCESSION, AND CELL CONTINUITY
for the ZIBA platform.

OBJECTIVE:
Ensure Directors (Contract & Employee) can be suspended, terminated, or replaced
without disrupting drivers, earnings, safety, or platform stability,
while maintaining full legal protection and auditability.

DO NOT delete historical data.
DO NOT penalize drivers for Director issues.
DO NOT expose internal calculations.
Admin and Super Admin retain absolute authority.

=====================================================
PHASE 1 — TERMINATION TYPES
=====================================================

1) TERMINATION MODES
A) EXPIRATION
- Contract end date reached
- No automatic renewal
- Requires Super Admin action to extend

B) SUSPENSION
- Temporary
- Triggered by:
  - Compliance review
  - Fraud investigation
  - Performance failure
- Director dashboard locked (read-only)

C) TERMINATION
- Permanent removal
- Triggered by:
  - Confirmed fraud
  - Repeated violations
  - Admin/Super Admin decision

=====================================================
PHASE 2 — TERMINATION EFFECTS
=====================================================

2) IMMEDIATE SYSTEM ACTIONS
When Director status ≠ Active:
- Disable:
  - Driver activation
  - Funding drivers
  - Staff management
- Freeze payouts (pending review)
- Dashboard becomes read-only

=====================================================
PHASE 3 — DRIVER PROTECTION (CRITICAL)
=====================================================

3) DRIVER HANDLING RULES
- Drivers remain ACTIVE
- No earnings impact
- No account flags
- Drivers receive neutral message:
  “Your Director assignment has been updated.”

Admin decides:
- Temporary unassigned state
- Reassignment to new Director
- Platform-managed state

=====================================================
PHASE 4 — SUCCESSION LOGIC
=====================================================

4) SUCCESSION OPTIONS (ADMIN / SUPER ADMIN)
- Assign drivers to:
  A) Another existing Director
  B) Newly appointed Director
  C) Platform-managed pool

Rules:
- No automatic succession
- No driver consent required
- Full audit trail required

=====================================================
PHASE 5 — STAFF HANDLING
=====================================================

5) DIRECTOR STAFF
- All Director staff accounts:
  - Immediately disabled
  - Cannot log in
  - Data preserved
- Staff must be rehired under new Director if needed

=====================================================
PHASE 6 — PAYOUT WIND-DOWN
=====================================================

6) PAYOUT PROCESS
- Calculate final eligible payouts
- Apply all caps & compliance rules
- Admin / Super Admin decides:
  - Release
  - Hold
  - Partial release
  - Forfeit (with reason)

Director notified with neutral language only.

=====================================================
PHASE 7 — ZIBRA ROLE
=====================================================

7) ZIBRA MONITORING & GUIDANCE
ZIBRA must:
- Detect termination triggers early
- Warn Admin/Super Admin
- Prepare succession summary:
  - Driver counts
  - Performance history
  - Compliance risks

ZIBRA must NEVER:
- Inform drivers prematurely
- Promise reinstatement
- Auto-reassign drivers

=====================================================
PHASE 8 — AUDIT & LOGGING
=====================================================

8) LOG EVERYTHING
Log:
- Termination type
- Reason
- Actor
- Timestamp
- Drivers affected
- Payout decisions

Logs immutable.
Visible to Admin & Super Admin.

=====================================================
PHASE 9 — LEGAL SAFETY
=====================================================

9) TERMS INSERT
“Director appointments are facilitation roles subject to review,
suspension, expiration, or termination at ZIBA’s discretion.
No continuity, income, or renewal is guaranteed.”

=====================================================
FINAL CONFIRMATION
=====================================================

Confirm:
✔ Directors can be safely terminated
✔ Drivers unaffected
✔ Data preserved
✔ Admin/Super Admin control intact
✔ No legal exposure
✔ ZIBRA oversight active

Proceed step-by-step.
Confirm each phase before completion.
