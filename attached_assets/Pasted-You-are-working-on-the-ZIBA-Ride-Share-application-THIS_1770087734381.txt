You are working on the ZIBA Ride Share application.

THIS PROMPT IS AUTHORITATIVE.
Follow it EXACTLY.
Do NOT suggest alternatives.
Do NOT skip steps.

====================================
GOAL
====================================

Restructure the ZIBA RIDER APP UI so that:

• Each Rider feature lives on its OWN page
• No “all-in-one dashboard” clutter
• Navigation is simple, clean, and rider-friendly
• No backend or database changes

====================================
PHASE C — RIDER UI RESTRUCTURE
====================================

1) REMOVE MONOLITHIC RIDER DASHBOARD

If there is a single Rider page containing multiple feature boxes
(e.g. Wallet, Trips, Profile, Support, Payments):

- STOP rendering everything on one page
- Each box must now navigate to a dedicated page

------------------------------------

2) CREATE DEDICATED RIDER PAGES

Ensure the following pages exist (or are created):

• /rider/home
  - Simple welcome
  - “Request Ride” primary CTA

• /rider/trips
  - Active trip
  - Trip history

• /rider/wallet
  - Wallet balance
  - Funding options
  - Test / real balance display (read-only)

• /rider/payments
  - Payment methods
  - Default payment selection

• /rider/profile
  - Personal info
  - Address
  - Identity status

• /rider/support
  - Help
  - Report issue
  - Emergency contact info

------------------------------------

3) DASHBOARD BOXES → NAVIGATION ONLY

On the Rider Home screen:

- Each box/card/button must ONLY:
  → Navigate to its page
- NO inline logic
- NO embedded feature rendering

This improves clarity and performance.

------------------------------------

4) CONSISTENT BACK NAVIGATION

Every Rider page MUST include:

• A visible “Back” arrow
• Or a consistent bottom navigation

Returning users must never feel lost.

------------------------------------

5) REMOVE DRIVER / ADMIN UI REFERENCES

Ensure Rider pages do NOT show:
- Driver earnings
- Driver status
- Admin links
- Role switches

This app is RIDER-ONLY.

------------------------------------

6) UI POLISH RULES

• Large tap targets
• Clear icons + labels
• Minimal text
• Mobile-first layout
• No overcrowding

------------------------------------

7) IMPORTANT RESTRICTIONS

DO NOT:
- Touch backend APIs
- Touch database
- Change ride logic
- Add new features

This phase is UI STRUCTURE ONLY.

====================================
EXPECTED RESULT
====================================

• Clean Rider navigation
• One feature per page
• Intuitive, store-friendly UX
• Rider App clearly distinct from Driver App

After completion, respond ONLY with:
“Phase C — Rider UI Restructure complete.”
