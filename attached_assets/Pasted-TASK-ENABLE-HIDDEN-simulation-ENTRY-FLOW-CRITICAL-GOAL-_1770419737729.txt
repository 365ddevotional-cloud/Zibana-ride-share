TASK: ENABLE HIDDEN /simulation ENTRY FLOW (CRITICAL)

GOAL:
Allow admins, testers, and developers to enter Simulation Mode using a hidden URL:
  /simulation

This must activate full system-level simulation (already enabled) and unlock the complete Rider / Driver / Admin experience.

IMPLEMENT THE FOLLOWING EXACTLY:

1. ROUTE
Create a public route:
  GET /simulation

This route must be accessible without login.

2. SIMULATION ENTRY PAGE (UI)
On /simulation, render a minimal page with:
- Title: "Enter Simulation Code"
- Input: 9-digit numeric code (required)
- Button: "Start Simulation"
- Error message for invalid or expired codes

No marketing UI. No onboarding. Simple and clean.

3. CODE VALIDATION (BACKEND)
On submit:
- Validate code against simulation_codes table
- Check:
  - code exists
  - not expired
  - not revoked
- If invalid → return error
- If valid → activate simulation session

4. SESSION STORAGE (CRITICAL)
When valid:
- Store simulation context in session or secure cookie:
  - simulationActive = true
  - simulationRole (rider / driver / admin / director)
  - simulationCountry
  - simulationCity (if provided)
  - simulationWalletBalance
  - simulationRating
  - cashEnabled
  - simulationExpiresAt

This context must persist across refreshes and navigation.

5. REDIRECT FLOW
After successful code entry:
- Redirect user to normal login/signup flow
- DO NOT change login UX

6. POST-LOGIN OVERRIDE
After login:
- If simulationActive === true:
  - Override user role with simulationRole
  - Override country/location with simulationCountry
  - Bypass real verification checks
  - Inject simulated data (wallet, rating, documents)
  - Prevent access to real users or real money

7. VISUAL INDICATOR (MANDATORY)
When simulation is active:
- Show an amber banner at the top of ALL pages:
  "Simulation Mode Active — {Role} ({Country})"
- Include a button: "Exit Simulation"

8. EXIT SIMULATION
When "Exit Simulation" is clicked:
- Clear simulation session
- Redirect to normal app state
- Restore real user context

9. SAFETY GUARDS
While simulationActive === true:
- Block all real payouts
- Block real notifications
- Block real trips
- Block real wallets
- Use only simulated records

10. FAILURE HANDLING
If simulation expires:
- Auto-disable simulation
- Clear session
- Force re-entry via /simulation

11. CONFIRMATION
After implementation:
- Verify that entering /simulation works
- Verify a generated code activates full Rider/Driver/Admin experience
- Verify onboarding, maps, trips, cash/card logic all work in simulation

DO NOT:
- Remove Training module
- Auto-enable simulation without a code
- Expose /simulation link publicly

This must be hidden, controlled, and admin-driven only.
