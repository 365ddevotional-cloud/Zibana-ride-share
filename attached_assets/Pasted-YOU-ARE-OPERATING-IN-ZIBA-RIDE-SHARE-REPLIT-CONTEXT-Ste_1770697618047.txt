YOU ARE OPERATING IN ZIBA RIDE SHARE (REPLIT).

CONTEXT:
Step 5 (Admin Section Landing Pages) is COMPLETE and VERIFIED.
Do NOT revisit or modify Step 5.
Speed and safety are the priority.

OBJECTIVE — STEP 6: ADMIN UX HARDENING (SAFE + NON-DISRUPTIVE)

GOAL:
Improve admin usability and clarity WITHOUT touching:
- Rider flows
- Driver flows
- Backend
- Auth logic
- Permissions
- Existing admin business logic

RULES (STRICT):
- MODIFY UI ONLY
- NO new APIs
- NO schema changes
- NO state refactors
- NO logic refactors
- NO performance tuning
- NO feature expansion
- DO NOT rename routes
- DO NOT change permissions
- DO NOT touch admin/index.tsx monolith logic

ALLOWED FILE SCOPE (UI-ONLY):
✔ client/src/pages/admin/*
✔ client/src/components/admin/*
✖ rider/*
✖ driver/*
✖ backend/*
✖ auth/*
✖ middleware/*

STEP 6 TASKS (DO ALL):

1️⃣ ADMIN CONTEXT HEADER
- Add a small, consistent context header at the top of ALL admin pages:
  - Shows: Section Name (from route)
  - Optional short description (static map)
- MUST be read-only
- MUST NOT affect layout sizing or sidebar

2️⃣ EMPTY / FIRST-LOAD STATES
- For admin tables or sections that can load empty:
  - Add a neutral placeholder message
  - NO spinners
  - NO skeleton loaders
  - Text only (clean + professional)

3️⃣ VISUAL SAFETY GUARDS
- Add subtle visual separation so admin actions never look “tap-happy”:
  - Group destructive actions visually
  - No new confirmation modals
  - No logic changes
  - UI spacing only

4️⃣ ROUTE FALLBACK SAFETY
- If an unknown /admin/:section route is accessed:
  - Show a clean “Section not found” UI
  - Include link back to /admin/overview
  - UI-only, no routing changes

OUTPUT FORMAT (MANDATORY):
At completion, print ONLY:

REPORT:
- Files touched (exact paths)
- What was added (1-line per item)
- What was NOT touched (confirm rider/driver/backend/auth untouched)
- Status: READY FOR NEXT STEP

STOP AFTER REPORT.
DO NOT suggest Step 7.
DO NOT ask questions.
DO NOT continue after completion.
