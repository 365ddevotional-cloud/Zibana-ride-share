You are implementing RIDER TRUST, LOYALTY, AND WALLET GROWTH SYSTEMS
across the ZIBA platform.

OBJECTIVE:
Increase rider retention, reduce cancellations and abuse,
encourage wallet usage, and build long-term trust —
without exposing platform commission, creating legal guarantees,
or breaking existing ride/payment flows.

DO NOT introduce cashbacks as guaranteed income.
DO NOT create financial obligations.
DO NOT change pricing or commission visibility.

=====================================================
PHASE 1 — RIDER TRUST SCORE (RTS)

Score recalculated daily and after key events.

Weighted factors (configurable by Super Admin):

A) RELIABILITY (35%)
- Ride completion rate

B) PAYMENT BEHAVIOR (25%)
