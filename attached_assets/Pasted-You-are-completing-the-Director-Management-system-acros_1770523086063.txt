You are completing the Director Management system across the ZIBA platform.

OBJECTIVE:
Finalize Director governance, dashboards, permissions, lifecycle management,
commission enforcement, staff control, and ZIBRA oversight in a secure,
auditable, legally safe way.

This applies to:
- Contract Directors
- Employee Directors

Admin and Super Admin retain ultimate authority.

Do NOT break existing systems.
Do NOT expose platform revenue or commission math.
Do NOT weaken security or auditability.

=====================================================
DIRECTOR DEFINITIONS
=====================================================

1) CONTRACT DIRECTOR
- Recruits drivers via referral code
- Must recruit minimum 10 drivers to activate
- Can manage up to 3 driver cells
- Each cell:
  - Max active drivers: 1300
  - Max commissionable drivers/day: 1000
- Commission:
  - Percentage configurable by Super Admin
  - Applied ONLY to platform earnings from eligible drivers
  - Eligible drivers/day = 77% of drivers that worked that day
- Has lifecycle (start date + end date)
- Can be suspended or terminated by Admin/Super Admin

2) EMPLOYEE DIRECTOR
- Drivers assigned by platform
- No referral code ownership
- Same dashboard structure
- Same discipline responsibilities
- Employment governed separately (do not expose employment terms in UI)

=====================================================
DIRECTOR DASHBOARD (PRIVATE)
=====================================================

Route:
  /director/dashboard

Visible To:
- Director (own dashboard only)
- Admin
- Super Admin

Director Dashboard Sections:
- Overview
- Drivers (assigned only)
- Earnings Summary (masked)
- Staff Management
- Performance & Health
- Compliance & Notices
- ZIBRA Insights

-----------------------------------------------------
OVERVIEW

Director CANNOT:
- Deactivate drivers permanently
- See platform revenue
- Edit payout data

Admin/Super Admin can override all actions.

-----------------------------------------------------
STAFF MANAGEMENT (DIRECTOR-OWNED)
-----------------------------------------------------

Contract Directors may:
- Hire their own staff (ops, monitoring, support)
- Assign staff roles per section:
  - Driver Ops
  - Compliance
  - Monitoring
  - Reports
- Each staff:
  - Sees ONLY assigned sections
  - Cannot see payouts unless explicitly allowed
  - Cannot see other cells or directors

All staff actions:
- Must log actor ID
- Must log timestamp
- Must be visible to Admin/Super Admin

=====================================================
DIRECTOR LIFECYCLE MANAGEMENT
=====================================================

Admin / Super Admin controls:
- Appointment start date
- Appointment end date
- Renewal
- Suspension
- Termination

System behavior:
- Expired director → dashboard read-only
- Suspended director → dashboard locked + notice
- Terminated director → access revoked, logs preserved

=====================================================
ZIBRA OVERSIGHT FOR DIRECTORS
=====================================================

ZIBRA must:
- Continuously analyze director performance
- Track:
  - Driver churn
  - Driver suspensions
  - Abuse flags
  - Earnings volatility
  - Cell saturation
- Generate:
  - Performance nudges
  - Compliance reminders
  - Risk warnings

ZIBRA MAY:
- Prompt Director with suggestions
- Flag Admin/Super Admin silently

ZIBRA MUST NOT:
- Punish automatically
- Change payouts
- Suspend directors directly

=====================================================
LEGAL & COMPLIANCE SAFETY
=====================================================

Director-facing disclaimer (monthly + payout views):

"Director earnings are facilitation-based estimates subject to eligibility rules,
daily caps, compliance reviews, and platform policies. ZIBA does not guarantee
earnings, driver activity, or payout timelines."

Directors acknowledge:
- Platform acts as facilitator
- Drivers are not employees of Directors unless separately contracted
- Abuse or fraud leads to suspension or termination

=====================================================
AUDIT & ACCOUNTABILITY
=====================================================

- Director actions
- Staff actions
- Driver activations/suspensions
- Commission calculations

=====================================================

- Director dashboard routes
