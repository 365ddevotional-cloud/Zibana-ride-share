ZIBA SYSTEM — FULL ROLE EMULATION & EXPERIENCE SIMULATOR

This module enables Super Admin and Admin to generate a Simulation Code
that launches a FULL, END-TO-END, REALISTIC experience of the ZIBA app
for Rider, Driver, Director, or Admin roles.

THIS IS NOT A DEMO.
THIS IS FULL ROLE EMULATION.

================================================
SIMULATION OBJECTIVE
================================================

Simulation must:
• Walk through ALL onboarding steps
• Require ALL real inputs
• Accept ALL inputs (real or fake)
• Auto-approve verification stages
• Simulate ALL ride lifecycle states
• Match EXACTLY what real users will experience

The simulated experience MUST be identical to production UI/UX.

================================================
SIMULATION ENTRY (ADMIN)
================================================

Admin Dashboard → “Simulation Center”

Admin selects:
• Role:
  - Rider
  - Driver
  - Director
  - Admin
• Country (e.g. Nigeria, USA, Jamaica)
• Optional:
  - City / State
  - Driver tier (new / veteran)
  - Wallet balance
  - Rating state
  - Cash enabled / disabled

System generates:
• 6–9 digit Simulation Code
• Time-limited
• One-time or reusable (admin choice)

================================================
APP ENTRY FLOW (SIMULATION)
================================================

On Welcome Screen:
• Option: “Enter Simulation Code”

When valid code entered:
• App enters SIMULATION MODE
• Simulation banner shown internally
• User proceeds through FULL onboarding

================================================
FULL ONBOARDING — DRIVER (SIMULATED)
================================================

Driver must complete ALL steps:
• Personal details
• Vehicle type
• Plate number
• Car color
• Driver’s license
• NIN
• Insurance (if required)
• Map & location permissions

SIMULATION RULE:
• All fields MUST be filled
• App may suggest dummy values
• Validation passes automatically
• Verification auto-approved

NO STEP IS SKIPPED.
NO STEP IS HIDDEN.

================================================
FULL EXPERIENCE — DRIVER (SIMULATED)
================================================

Driver can:
• Go online / offline
• View map
• Receive simulated ride requests
• Accept / reject rides
• Navigate to pickup
• Wait for rider
• Experience rider cancellation
• Start trip
• Drive to destination
• End trip
• Receive cash / card simulation
• See earnings simulation
• See warnings, nudges, tips

Maps:
• Use mocked GPS movement
• Animate route, arrival, pickup, destination
• Mirror real navigation transitions

================================================
FULL EXPERIENCE — RIDER (SIMULATED)
================================================

Rider can:
• Request rides
• Select cash or card
• See ETA
• Cancel rides
• Pay driver (simulated)
• Rate driver

================================================
FULL EXPERIENCE — DIRECTOR / ADMIN (SIMULATED)
================================================

Director / Admin can:
• View dashboards
• Manage drivers
• See trips
• Trigger incentives
• Observe system behavior

================================================
BACKEND SIMULATION RULES
================================================

• All flows hit the SAME code paths as production
• Payments are sandboxed
• GPS is mocked
• No real money
• No real notifications
• No real users affected

================================================
SIMULATION DATA HANDLING
================================================

• Simulation data stored separately
• Auto-deleted after session
• Cannot leak into production

================================================
EXIT & SAFETY
================================================

• Logout exits simulation immediately
• Admin can revoke simulation anytime
• Simulation expires automatically

================================================
FINAL PRINCIPLE (LOCKED)
================================================

If a real user can experience it,
a simulated user MUST be able to experience it too.

Any missing flow is a simulation defect.
