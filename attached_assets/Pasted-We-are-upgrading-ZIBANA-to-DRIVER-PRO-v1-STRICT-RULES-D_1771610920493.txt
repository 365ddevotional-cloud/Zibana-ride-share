We are upgrading ZIBANA to DRIVER PRO v1.

STRICT RULES:
- DO NOT delete any existing tables.
- DO NOT modify wallet logic.
- DO NOT modify ride matching logic structure.
- DO NOT change existing schema fields.
- DO NOT generate destructive migrations.
- DO NOT alter production data.
- This is a backward-compatible upgrade only.

GOAL:
Implement Driver Pro v1 features without breaking current architecture.

========================================
PHASE 1 — DRIVER REQUEST OVERLAY
========================================

Create a full-screen ride request overlay component for /driver.

Features:
- Show rider first name only.
- Show rider rating (⭐).
- Show pickup address (shortened).
- Show drop-off area (approximate).
- Show estimated fare.
- Show distance to pickup.
- Show estimated trip duration.

Add:
- Large 12-second animated countdown bar.
- Bar shrinks smoothly left-to-right.
- Gradient color: green → yellow → red.
- Accept button.
- Decline button.
- Auto-decline at 12 seconds.

DO NOT change ride database.
Only enhance display + timeout logic.

========================================
PHASE 2 — SAFE RIDE LOCKING
========================================

When driver presses ACCEPT:

Server must:
- Check ride is still unassigned.
- Lock ride to first driver.
- Reject others safely.
- No schema change required.

========================================
PHASE 3 — NAVIGATION DEEP LINK
========================================

After ACCEPT:
Show:
"Navigate to Pickup" button.

On click:
Open Google Maps with coordinates using:

https://www.google.com/maps/dir/?api=1&destination=LAT,LNG&travelmode=driving

No manual address input.
Coordinates auto-filled.

After driver taps "Start Trip":
Switch navigation target to drop-off coordinates.

Ensure this works for:
- Browser
- Android PWA
- iOS PWA

========================================
PHASE 4 — DRIVER PREFERENCE (SAFE)
========================================

Add OPTIONAL boolean column to driver profile:

acceptWhileOnTrip Boolean @default(false)

This must be:
- Non-destructive migration.
- Safe to apply in production.

Add toggle in driver settings:
"Accept rides while on trip"

Add in main screen:
Toggle:
"Receiving Requests" ON/OFF

Logic:
If driver is ON_TRIP and acceptWhileOnTrip = false:
Do not send new ride events.

If true:
Allow next ride popup.

========================================
PHASE 5 — SAFE DEPLOY STRATEGY
========================================

- Use non-destructive migration only.
- Verify prisma migrate dev works.
- Verify prisma generate works.
- Run app.
- Confirm no schema drift.
- Confirm no data loss.
- Ensure publish will not fail.

Report:
- Exactly what was added.
- Confirm no existing tables altered.
- Confirm publish-safe.
