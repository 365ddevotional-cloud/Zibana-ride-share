You are working on the ZIBA Ride Share Platform (Rider App, Driver App, Admin Dashboard).

MISSION:
Implement a complete Accident Report Protocol and Lost Item Protocol that:
- Protects riders and drivers
- Creates fair incentives
- Generates revenue for ZIBA
- Reduces disputes
- Matches production-grade ride-hailing standards

Do NOT change existing pricing splits, commissions, or wallet logic unless explicitly stated.

====================================================
1️⃣ ACCIDENT REPORT PROTOCOL (SYSTEM-WIDE)
====================================================

GOALS:
- Prioritize safety
- Prevent false claims
- Protect ZIBA legally
- Encourage honest reporting

IMPLEMENT:

A. Incident Trigger Methods
- Manual: Rider or Driver taps "Report an Incident"
- Automatic flags:
  - Sudden trip stop + inactivity
  - GPS deviation
  - Emergency button tap

B. In-App Safety Flow (Rider & Driver)
Step 1: Safety Check Screen
- Question: “Are you safe right now?”
- Options:
  - Everyone is safe
  - Emergency services needed

If emergency selected:
- Show local emergency numbers
- Allow 1-tap call
- Instantly notify ZIBA Safety Admin

Step 2: Incident Details Form
- Accident severity:
  - Minor (no injury)
  - Moderate
  - Serious
- Required:
  - Photo uploads
  - Short text or voice explanation
- Optional:
  - Witness contact

RULE:
- No blame language
- ZIBA does NOT admit fault automatically

C. Admin Safety Review Dashboard
Admin can view:
- GPS replay
- Speed data
- Timeline
- Uploaded evidence
- Rider & driver history

Outcomes:
- Minor → close trip normally
- Moderate → temporary review
- Serious → suspend matching pending investigation

Driver Incentives:
- Honest reporting = faster reinstatement
- Safety badge
- Priority rematching after clearance

====================================================
2️⃣ LOST ITEM PROTOCOL (PROFITABLE + FAIR)
====================================================

GOALS:
- Encourage item return
- Pay drivers fairly
- Reduce disputes
- Create a paid micro-service

A. Rider Flow
Trips → Select Ride → Report Lost Item
Fields:
- Item type
- Urgency (standard / urgent)
- Preferred return method:
  - Meet driver
  - ZIBA hub
  - Courier delivery

B. Driver Confirmation
Driver receives inbox + push:
“A rider reported a lost item. Do you have this item?”

Options:
- Yes, I have it
- No, I do not have it

If NO → case closed politely
If YES → paid return flow begins

C. Paid Return Fee (Mandatory)
- Rider pays a Lost Item Return Fee via wallet
- Fee tiers:
  - Standard
  - Urgent

D. Revenue Split
- Driver receives 70–80%
- ZIBA receives 20–30%

E. Return Options
1. Meet-up (midpoint suggested)
2. ZIBA Hub drop-off
3. Courier arranged by ZIBA

Protections:
- Driver uploads item photo
