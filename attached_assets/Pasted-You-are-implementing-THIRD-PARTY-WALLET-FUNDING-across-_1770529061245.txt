You are implementing THIRD-PARTY WALLET FUNDING
across the ZIBA platform (Rider, Admin, Super Admin).

OBJECTIVE:
Allow trusted users (parents, spouses, employers, friends)
to fund a rider’s wallet safely — without creating loans,
debts, guarantees, or legal liability.

This is a CONVENIENCE FEATURE, not a financial service.

DO NOT:
- Create repayment obligations
- Allow forced transfers
- Allow anonymous funding
- Expose internal commissions
- Break existing wallet flows

=====================================================
PHASE 1 — FUNDING RELATIONSHIP TYPES
=====================================================

1) FUNDING TYPES (EXPLICITLY LABELED)

A) PERSONAL SUPPORT
- Parent → Child
- Spouse → Spouse
- Friend → Friend

B) CORPORATE SUPPORT
- Employer → Employee
- Organization → Member

Each relationship must be:
- Initiated by the FUNDER
- Accepted by the RECIPIENT
- Revocable by either party

=====================================================
PHASE 2 — FUNDING INVITE FLOW
=====================================================

2) FUNDING INVITE PROCESS

FUNDER:
- Enter recipient phone/email/username
- Choose funding type
- Set optional:
  - Daily limit
  - Monthly limit
  - Purpose tag (e.g. school, work, family)

RECIPIENT:
- Receives in-app notification
- Must ACCEPT or DECLINE
- Can revoke anytime

No auto-linking without acceptance.

=====================================================
