You are implementing DIRECTOR-TO-DRIVER WALLET FUNDING in the ZIBA platform.

This feature allows Directors to financially support drivers under strict rules,
without exposing ZIBA to liability, fraud, or labor classification risk.

DO NOT break existing wallet logic.
DO NOT allow Directors to withdraw funds from drivers.
DO NOT allow Directors to see driver private wallet history beyond funding records.
DO NOT create employer-employee liability.

=====================================================
PHASE 1 — FUNDING CONCEPT (WHAT THIS IS & IS NOT)
=====================================================

1) WHAT THIS FEATURE IS
- Optional financial assistance
- Wallet credit only
- Non-repayable unless explicitly configured
- Used to:
  - help drivers stay active
  - cover temporary low-balance issues
  - encourage performance

2) WHAT THIS FEATURE IS NOT
- NOT salary
- NOT loan by default
- NOT guaranteed income
- NOT wage advance
- NOT enforceable debt

=====================================================
PHASE 2 — WHO CAN FUND WHO
=====================================================

3) ELIGIBILITY RULES
- Director can fund ONLY drivers assigned to their cell
- Employee Directors:
  - funding limits defined by Admin / Super Admin
- Contract Directors:
  - funding allowed ONLY from their own funded Director Wallet
- Directors cannot fund:
  - drivers outside their cell
  - suspended or deactivated drivers

=====================================================
PHASE 3 — DIRECTOR WALLET (ISOLATED)
=====================================================

4) DIRECTOR WALLET
Create a separate wallet type:
- walletType = DIRECTOR_WALLET
- Funded by:
  - card
  - bank transfer
  - internal settlement (Admin-approved)
- Cannot receive rider payments
- Cannot receive driver earnings

5) WALLET RULES
- Director Wallet → Driver Wallet only
- No reverse transfers
- No cash-out by Director unless Admin-approved
- All transactions logged

=====================================================
PHASE 4 — FUNDING RULES & CAPS
=====================================================

6) FUNDING LIMITS (CONFIGURABLE)
Defaults (editable by Super Admin):
- Per driver per day cap
- Per driver per week cap
- Per director daily cap
- Per director monthly cap

7) PURPOSE TAGGING (MANDATORY)
Every funding must include a purpose tag:
- “Low wallet balance”
- “Incentive”
- “Temporary support”
- “Ops assistance”

=====================================================
PHASE 5 — DRIVER EXPERIENCE
=====================================================

8) DRIVER RECEIPT
When funded:
- Driver receives:
  - inbox message
  - push notification
- Message language:
  “Your wallet has been credited to help you continue driving.”

No obligation language.
No repayment pressure.

9) DRIVER VISIBILITY
Driver can see:
- amount
- date
- director name
- purpose tag

Driver CANNOT see:
- director wallet balance
- director commissions
- director funding rules

=====================================================
PHASE 6 — ADMIN & SUPER ADMIN CONTROLS
=====================================================

10) ADMIN DASHBOARD
Admins can:
- View all director funding activity
- Filter by:
  - director
  - driver
  - date
  - amount
- Flag suspicious patterns
- Suspend funding privileges

11) SUPER ADMIN POWERS
Super Admin can:
- Adjust limits
- Enable/disable funding per director
- Convert funding mode to “recoverable” (future, optional)
- Freeze Director Wallets

=====================================================
PHASE 7 — ZIBRA SUPPORT BEHAVIOR
=====================================================

12) ZIBRA FOR DIRECTORS
ZIBRA may:
- Explain funding rules
- Warn when limits are near
- Suggest non-monetary alternatives

ZIBRA must NEVER:
- Suggest funding guarantees
- Pressure funding
- Imply obligation

13) ZIBRA FOR DRIVERS
If asked:
“Do I have to pay it back?”
ZIBRA response:
- Neutral
- Clear
- Non-binding
Example:
“Director support is optional assistance. Terms vary and are shown before acceptance.”

=====================================================
PHASE 8 — LEGAL & TERMS SAFETY
=====================================================

14) TERMS INSERT (MANDATORY)
- Director funding is discretionary
- No obligation to fund
- No obligation to repay unless explicitly stated
- ZIBA is not a party to funding agreements
- ZIBA only facilitates wallet crediting

=====================================================
PHASE 9 — ABUSE & FRAUD PROTECTION
=====================================================

15) ABUSE PATTERNS TO FLAG
- Same driver repeatedly funded
- Director funding tied to coercive messages
- Funding used to influence ratings or behavior

16) AUTOMATIC ACTIONS
- Soft warnings via ZIBRA
- Auto-limit reductions
- Admin review escalation

=====================================================
PHASE 10 — AUDIT & LOGGING
=====================================================

17) LOG EVERYTHING
Log:
- who funded
- who received
- amount
- purpose
- timestamp
- IP/session

Logs visible to:
- Admin
- Super Admin
Only summaries visible to Director.

=====================================================
CONFIRMATION
=====================================================

After implementation, confirm:
✔ Wallet isolation intact
✔ No liability language
✔ Abuse flags working
✔ ZIBRA responses compliant
✔ No commission logic affected

Proceed step-by-step.
Confirm after each phase.
