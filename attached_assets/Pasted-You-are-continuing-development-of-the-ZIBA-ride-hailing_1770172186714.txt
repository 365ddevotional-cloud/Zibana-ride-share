You are continuing development of the ZIBA ride-hailing platform.

GOAL:
Fully separate the Driver App from the Rider App while keeping a shared backend.

CURRENT STATE:
- ZIBA is a full-stack app (React + Node + Prisma).
- Rider App separation is COMPLETE.
- Driver features already exist but are still partially mixed with shared routes/components.
- Backend already supports roles: RIDER, DRIVER, ADMIN.
- Authentication and wallets exist.

TASK:
Proceed with ZIBA Driver App Separation.

DO NOT touch Rider App logic or UI.

SCOPE OF WORK (EXECUTE IN ORDER):

1. ROUTING & STRUCTURE
- Create isolated driver routes under `/driver`
- Add a DriverAppGuard that allows ONLY users with role = DRIVER
- Ensure Rider users cannot access any driver pages
- Admin remains separate

2. DRIVER AUTH & PROFILE
- Ensure driver login/session is fully independent
- Driver profile must include:
  - Full name
  - Phone number
  - Vehicle details (can be mock/test data)
  - Driver status: offline / online
- Driver dashboard loads ONLY driver-specific data

3. DRIVER DASHBOARD
- Show:
  - Driver availability toggle (online/offline)
  - Incoming ride requests (real-time or simulated)
  - Active trip view
  - Earnings summary (mock data allowed)
- NO rider components reused visually

4. DRIVER TRIP FLOW
- Accept / reject ride request
- Start trip
- End trip
- Update trip status in backend
- Sync with rider trip status

5. DATA ISOLATION
- Driver sees ONLY:
  - Trips assigned to them
  - Their earnings
  - Their ratings
- No access to rider wallets or rider history

6. UI RULES
- Driver UI must feel like a separate app
- Different layout from Rider App
- Clear “Driver Mode” labeling
- Keep design consistent with ZIBA branding

7. SAFETY RULES
- No shared state leakage between Rider and Driver
- All role checks must be server-side enforced
- Do NOT break existing Rider App or Admin App

OUTPUT EXPECTATION:
- Fully isolated Driver App flow
- Clean driver-only routes
- Secure role enforcement
- App should be previewable without errors

IMPORTANT:
- Work step-by-step
- Do NOT skip steps
- If a conflict is found, fix it before moving forward
