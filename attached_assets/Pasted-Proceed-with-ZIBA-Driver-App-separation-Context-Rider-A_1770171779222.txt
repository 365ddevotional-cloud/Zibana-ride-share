Proceed with ZIBA Driver App separation.

Context:
- Rider App separation is already complete and live
- Admin Dashboard exists but is currently blocked by routing guards (DO NOT touch admin now)
- Shared production database is stable and correct
- Role system already exists (driver, rider, admin, super_admin, etc.)

GOAL:
Create a fully separated ZIBA Driver App without breaking:
- Rider App
- Admin App
- Authentication
- Production data

DO NOT:
- Modify database schemas
- Modify existing Rider or Admin routes
- Change role definitions
- Apply global route guards

PHASE 1 — ROUTING SEPARATION
1. Introduce a dedicated Driver App namespace:
   - /driver
   - /driver/*
2. Driver routes must NOT be accessible from:
   - /
   - /rider/*
   - /admin/*
3. Driver routes must be isolated at the router level

PHASE 2 — DRIVER ACCESS CONTROL
1. Create DriverAppGuard that:
   - Allows ONLY users with role = driver
   - Blocks rider, admin, super_admin roles
2. DriverAppGuard must apply ONLY to /driver/*
3. If a non-driver accesses /driver/*:
   - Show a clear error:
     “This app is for Drivers only. Please use the correct ZIBA app for your role.”
   - Do NOT redirect into rider or admin flows

PHASE 3 — AUTH FLOW
1. Driver login must:
   - Authenticate normally
   - Fetch role from /api/user/role
   - Route user to /driver/dashboard if role = driver
2. Do NOT auto-redirect drivers into rider or admin areas

PHASE 4 — UI ISOLATION
1. Driver App must have:
   - Its own layout
   - Its own navigation
   - No Rider UI elements
2. Branding stays ZIBA but UI context must clearly say “Driver”

PHASE 5 — DATA ACCESS
1. Driver App can read/write ONLY:
   - Driver profile
   - Assigned trips
   - Earnings
   - Availability status
2. Driver App must NOT access:
   - Rider management
   - Admin tools
   - System settings

PHASE 6 — VERIFICATION
Confirm the following URLs work correctly:

- Rider App:
  https://ziba-ride-share.replit.app
  → Riders only

- Driver App:
  https://ziba-ride-share.replit.app/driver
  → Drivers only

- Admin App:
  https://ziba-ride-share.replit.app/admin
  → Leave untouched for now

EXPECTED RESULT:
- Three logically separate apps inside one deployment:
  1. Rider App (/)
  2. Driver App (/driver)
  3. Admin App (/admin)
- No role leakage
- No routing conflicts
- No regressions

Do not mark this task complete until:
- /driver loads independently
- Non-driver roles are blocked from /driver
- Rider and Admin apps remain unaffected
