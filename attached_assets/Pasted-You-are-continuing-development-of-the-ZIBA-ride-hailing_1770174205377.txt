You are continuing development of the ZIBA ride-hailing platform.

PHASE 2 GOAL:
Make Driver authentication, session handling, and profile data fully independent and driver-specific.
Do NOT modify Rider App or Admin App behavior.

EXECUTE ALL STEPS BELOW IN ORDER WITHOUT SKIPPING.

1. DRIVER LOGIN PAGE
Ensure /src/driver/pages/DriverLogin.tsx exists and is used ONLY for drivers.

- Driver login must:
  - Authenticate using existing backend auth
  - Enforce role = DRIVER after login
  - Redirect to /driver after success
  - Block RIDER and ADMIN accounts

If a non-driver logs in, show an error or redirect to /unauthorized.

2. DRIVER SESSION ISOLATION
Ensure driver session:
- Uses the same auth token system
- But is validated by role on EVERY driver route
- Never leaks rider state into driver views

Confirm DriverAppGuard protects all /driver routes.

3. DRIVER PROFILE MODEL (FRONTEND + BACKEND SAFE CHECK)
Ensure driver profile data includes:

- fullName
- phoneNumber
- vehicleMake
- vehicleModel
- vehiclePlate
- driverStatus (ONLINE | OFFLINE)

If backend already has a Driver table, reuse it.
If not, safely extend schema WITHOUT affecting riders.

Mock data is acceptable if backend fields are missing.

4. DRIVER PROFILE FETCH
On DriverDashboard load:
- Fetch ONLY the authenticated driver’s profile
- Never fetch all users
- Never expose rider data

Use driverId from authenticated session.

5. DRIVER STATUS TOGGLE
Add driver availability toggle:
- ONLINE / OFFLINE
- Stored in backend or mocked state
- Default = OFFLINE

Driver must NOT receive ride requests when OFFLINE.

6. DRIVER DASHBOARD VALIDATION
Confirm dashboard shows:
- Driver name
- Vehicle summary
- Driver status toggle
- No rider wallet, rider history, or rider UI elements

7. SAFETY RULES (MANDATORY)
- All role validation must be server-side enforced
- No Rider component reuse
- No Admin access to driver dashboard
- No breaking changes to Rider App

8. VERIFICATION CHECKLIST
Confirm:
- Driver logs in and lands on /driver
- Rider cannot log in via driver login
- Admin blocked from /driver
- Driver profile loads correctly
- Driver status toggle works
- No console errors

STOP AFTER COMPLETION.
Do NOT proceed to Phase 3 until Phase 2 is confirmed complete.
