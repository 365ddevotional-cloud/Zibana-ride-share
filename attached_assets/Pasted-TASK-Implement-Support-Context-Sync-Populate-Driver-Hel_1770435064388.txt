TASK: Implement Support Context Sync + Populate Driver Help Center for ZIBA.

GOALS:
1) Ensure Support Team automatically receives rich app context from Rider, Driver, and Director apps.
2) Build a complete Driver Help Center with proactive answers.
3) Never expose internal revenue splits, commissions, or platform percentages.
4) Prepare UX for Google Play Store and Apple App Store review.

================================================
PART A — SUPPORT CONTEXT SHARING (CRITICAL)
================================================

Implement automatic support-context payloads for ALL support interactions.

Whenever a user (rider, driver, or director) opens Help Center, searches, or contacts support, attach the following metadata invisibly:

COMMON CONTEXT (ALL ROLES):
- App type (Rider / Driver / Director / Admin)
- User ID
- Role
- Country
- City
- App version
- Device type (mobile / web)
- OS (Android / iOS / Web)
- Language
- Network status
- Timestamp

RIDER-SPECIFIC CONTEXT:
- Current payment method (cash / wallet / card)
- Last trip status (if any)
- Wallet balance (masked)
- Current screen

DRIVER-SPECIFIC CONTEXT:
- Driver tier (new / active / trusted)
- Verification status
- Online / offline status
- Current trip state (idle / en route / on trip)
- Cash enabled (yes/no)
- Last payout status

DIRECTOR / ADMIN CONTEXT:
- Organization / fleet (if applicable)
- Active permissions
- Current dashboard section

RULES:
- Context is READ-ONLY for support
- No sensitive financial splits exposed
- No manual data entry required by users
- Context auto-refreshes per session

RESULT:
Support agents immediately see “what the user sees” and can answer faster.

================================================
PART B — DRIVER HELP CENTER (DRIVER APP CENTER)
================================================

Create a dedicated Driver Help Center inside the Driver app.

REMOVE:
- Empty states
- “No articles found”
- “No categories available”
