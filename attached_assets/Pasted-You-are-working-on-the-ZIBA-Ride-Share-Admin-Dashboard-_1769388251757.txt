You are working on the ZIBA Ride Share Admin Dashboard UI.

GOAL:
Reorganize the Admin Dashboard layout to look clean, modern, exciting, and highly readable,
and visually elevate the main navigation section.

SCOPE:
UI / UX ONLY — NO business logic, routing, auth, RBAC, or data changes.

TASKS (DO ALL):

1) PAGE LAYOUT REORGANIZATION
- Apply a clear visual hierarchy:
  - Header (ZIBA logo + role badge)
  - KPI Cards (top metrics)
  - Revenue Overview
  - Primary Navigation Section
  - Management Panels (Drivers, Riders, Trips, etc.)
- Add consistent spacing, alignment, and section separation
- Ensure the page feels balanced, not crowded

2) PRIMARY NAVIGATION BAR STYLING
Target the section containing:
Drivers | Riders | Trips | Payouts | Ratings | Disputes | Refunds | Chargebacks | Wallets | Directors | Reports | Fraud | Incentives | etc.

Apply the following styles:
- Background color: DARK AMBER
  (deep amber / burnt gold tone, not yellow)
- Text color: PURE WHITE
- Font weight: BOLD
- Add subtle black outline or divider lines to improve contrast
- Increase vertical padding for better clickability
- Ensure icons (if any) remain visible and crisp

3) READABILITY & ACCESSIBILITY
- Maintain WCAG-friendly contrast
- Ensure text remains readable on all screen sizes
- No hover gimmicks that reduce clarity
- Buttons and nav items should feel “solid” and premium

4) VISUAL EXCITEMENT (WITHOUT FLASHINESS)
- Slight elevation or shadow on navigation bar
- Smooth, subtle hover state (no animation overload)
- Keep the professional fintech / transport tone

5) HARD RULES (DO NOT VIOLATE):
- DO NOT change routes
- DO NOT change permissions
- DO NOT change role visibility
- DO NOT add or remove navigation items
- DO NOT alter data fetching or components’ logic

FINAL RESULT:
- Admin Dashboard looks organized, premium, and exciting
- Navigation bar stands out clearly with dark amber background
- White bold text is highly readable with strong contrast
- No functional regressions

Implement fully and cleanly.
