You are working on the ZIBA Ride Share platform (Rider App, Driver App, Admin Dashboard).
Proceed carefully. Do NOT break existing functionality. First audit what already exists, then ADD ONLY what is missing.

GOAL:
Implement the complete ZIBA Safe Return Hub system for Lost Items & Accidents, including UI flows, admin controls, driver training, legal terms, fraud prevention, and trust score logic.

=====================================
PHASE 1 — LOST ITEM + SAFE RETURN HUB
=====================================

1) LOST ITEM CORE LOGIC
- Create a persistent `lost_item_case` model with:
  - id
  - trip_id
  - rider_id
  - driver_id
  - item_category
  - description
  - photos[]
  - status (reported, checking, found, hub_dropped, returned, closed)
  - return_method (direct_meet | safe_return_hub)
  - hub_id (nullable)
  - timestamps
- Ensure cases are immutable and fully auditable.

2) RIDER APP — LOST ITEM FLOW
Add the following screens (only if missing):
- Report Lost Item (trip selector, item category, description, photo upload)
- Lost Item Status Tracker with real-time updates
- Item Found Notification
- Safe Return Hub Pickup Details
- Pickup Confirmation screen
- After confirmation, show thank-you + optional tip prompt

Ensure:
- Rider phone number is NOT shared by default
- In-app messaging is enabled once driver confirms item found
- Rider sees clear safety messaging

3) DRIVER APP — LOST ITEM FLOW
Add:
- Lost Item Alert screen (Found / Not Found)
- Return Method selector (Safe Return Hub recommended)
- Hub selection map/list
- Drop-off confirmation with photo proof
- Completion screen showing reward + trust score increase

Ensure:
- Driver phone number is shared ONLY after item is returned and confirmed
- All actions are logged

=====================================
PHASE 2 — SAFE RETURN HUBS
=====================================

4) SAFE RETURN HUB SYSTEM
- Create `safe_return_hubs` table:
  - id
  - name
  - address
  - city
  - hours
  - partner_type (store, fuel_station, office)
  - active_status
- Assign hubs per city
- Hubs act as neutral drop-off points
- Reduces conflict and improves safety

5) ADMIN DASHBOARD — SAFE RETURN
Add Admin menu:
Safety → Lost Items & Safe Return

Admin abilities:
- View all lost item cases
- Filter by city, status, driver, rider
- View full timeline + messages + photos
- Override status
- Flag fraud
- Adjust rewards
- Close cases

=====================================
PHASE 3 — ACCIDENT REPORT PROTOCOL
=====================================

6) ACCIDENT REPORTING
- Allow drivers and riders to report accidents
- Capture:
  - trip_id
  - location
  - description
  - photos
  - injuries flag
- Notify Admin immediately
- Freeze trip payouts until reviewed

7) DRIVER ACCIDENT RELIEF FUND
- Create configurable relief fund
- Allow Admin to approve payouts
- Track relief usage per driver
- Tie abuse to trust score penalties

=====================================
PHASE 4 — FRAUD, TRUST & ANALYTICS
=====================================

8) AI FRAUD DETECTION (LIGHTWEIGHT)
Flag patterns such as:
- Repeated lost item claims
- Same driver/rider pairing abuse
- Frequent unclaimed items
- False confirmations

9) TRUST SCORE IMPACT
- Increase trust score for:
  - Item returned
  - Safe Return Hub usage
- Decrease trust score for:
  - False claims
  - Refusals
  - Abuse patterns

10) ANALYTICS & SAFEGUARDS
Track:
- Lost item frequency
- Age bracket (if available)
- City & hotspot areas
- Driver return rate
- Rider abuse patterns

=====================================
PHASE 5 — COMMUNICATION & NOTIFICATIONS
=====================================

11) IN-APP MESSAGING
- Enable case-based messaging (driver ↔ rider)
- Messages visible to Admin
- Auto-close messaging after case resolution

12) NOTIFICATIONS
- Notifications ON by default
- User can disable in Settings
- Notifications behave like SMS:
  - Push + in-app
- Triggers:
  - Item found
  - Hub drop-off
  - Pickup reminder
  - Case closed

13) INBOX UI
- Add Inbox unread badge (red circle with count)
- Add welcome message from ZIBA:
  “Welcome to ZIBA. We’re happy to have you.”
- Messages categorized (System, Safety, Promotions)

=====================================
PHASE 6 — SETTINGS, UI & UX POLISH
=====================================

14) SETTINGS (RIDER & DRIVER)
Add:
- Notifications toggle
- Appearance (Light / Dark / Auto)
- Saved places (Home / Work)
- Communication preferences
- Privacy controls

15) UI CONSISTENCY
- Match rider app typography scale to landing page
- Larger, cleaner fonts
- Maintain ZIBA branding (not copying competitors)

=====================================
PHASE 7 — LEGAL & TRAINING
=====================================

16) TERMS & CONDITIONS
Add Lost & Found and Accident clauses:
- ZIBA not liable for lost items
- Safe Return Hubs are optional but recommended
- Fees/rewards discretionary
- Fraud leads to suspension
- Unclaimed items handled per policy

17) DRIVER TRAINING MODULE
- What to do when item is found
- Safe Return Hub benefits
- What NOT to do
- Trust score impact
- Safety-first mindset

=====================================
PHASE 8 — APPROVAL SYSTEM FIX
=====================================

18) DRIVER & TRAINEE APPROVAL
Fix missing approval flow:
- Restore Admin ability to approve:
  - New driver signups
  - Driver trainees
- Add approval queue with:
  - Approve
  - Reject
  - Request info
- Sync approval status to Driver App (remove “Pending Approval” once approved)

=====================================
FINAL RULES
=====================================

- Do NOT break existing ZIBA features
- Check existing implementations first
- Add only missing components
- Keep everything configurable via Admin
- Confirm each phase works end-to-end before marking complete

Proceed step-by-step and report completion per phase.
