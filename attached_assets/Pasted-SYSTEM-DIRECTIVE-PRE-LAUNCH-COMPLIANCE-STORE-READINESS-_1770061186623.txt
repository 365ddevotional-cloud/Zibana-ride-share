SYSTEM DIRECTIVE — PRE-LAUNCH COMPLIANCE & STORE READINESS (FINAL)

You are working on the ZIBA Ride Share application.

OBJECTIVE:
Prepare ZIBA for public release readiness WITHOUT introducing new core systems.
This phase focuses ONLY on compliance, safety posture, store approval, and launch controls.

RULES:
- DO NOT modify ride logic, payments logic, wallets, or payouts.
- DO NOT introduce new business features.
- DO NOT weaken existing security or enforcement.
- All changes must be additive, defensive, and reversible.
- This phase MUST be reversible (soft launch).

==================================================
PHASE SCOPE — COMPLIANCE & READINESS ONLY
==================================================

1) APP STORE COMPLIANCE CHECKS
- Verify the following are present and linked in-app:
  • Terms of Service
  • Privacy Policy
  • Community Guidelines
  • Refund & Dispute Policy
- Ensure links are accessible pre-signup and post-login.
- Add compliance confirmation logs on first app use.

2) USER CONSENT & DISCLOSURE
- Explicit consent checkboxes for:
  • Location tracking during rides
  • Camera usage (profile + live verification)
  • Background safety monitoring
- Consent must be:
  • Logged
  • Versioned
  • Required before activation

3) PRODUCTION SAFETY GUARDS
- Add system-wide flags:
  • SOFT_LAUNCH = true
  • HARD_LAUNCH = false
- Enable:
  • Rate limits
  • Abuse throttles
  • Emergency disable (kill switch)
- SUPER_ADMIN only can toggle these flags.

4) TEST MODE ISOLATION
- Ensure:
  • Testers are clearly marked (badge + backend flag)
  • Test rides are excluded from analytics & revenue reports
  • Test wallets cannot interact with real payments
- Confirm no leakage between TEST and REAL modes.

5) INCIDENT & AUDIT READINESS
- Ensure all of the following are logged immutably:
  • Ride lifecycle events
  • Payment attempts
  • Refund decisions
  • Admin actions
  • Safety incidents
- Logs must be exportable for:
  • Regulators
  • App store review
  • Legal defense

6) CONTENT & BRAND SAFETY
- Verify:
  • No misleading claims
  • No prohibited content
  • Clear explanation of fees & commissions
- Ensure driver/rider earnings disclosures are accurate.

7) STORE METADATA READINESS
- Prepare:
  • App description (neutral, factual, compliant)
  • Feature list (no guarantees, no exaggeration)
  • Safety & trust section
- Avoid language that implies:
  • Guaranteed income
  • Zero risk
  • Law enforcement replacement

8) FINAL LOCK & VERIFICATION
- Assert:
  • COMPLIANCE_READY = true
  • STORE_READY = true
  • CORE_SYSTEMS_LOCKED = true
- Provide a final readiness summary.

==================================================
FINAL OUTPUT REQUIRED
==================================================

Return a checklist-style confirmation that:
1) App Store compliance is satisfied
2) Legal disclosures are active
3) Test mode is isolated
4) Soft launch controls are enabled
5) System is safe to submit for review

Do not proceed beyond this phase.

END.
