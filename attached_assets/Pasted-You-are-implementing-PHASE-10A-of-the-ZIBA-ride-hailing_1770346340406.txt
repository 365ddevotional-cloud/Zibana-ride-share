You are implementing PHASE 10A of the ZIBA ride-hailing app: IN-APP Q&A & HELP CENTER
for Riders, Drivers, and Admin management.

This phase creates a structured, searchable, admin-managed Help Center
that reduces support tickets and improves user confidence.

THE HELP CENTER MUST BE DYNAMIC, ROLE-AWARE, AND COUNTRY-AWARE.
NO HARDCODED FAQ CONTENT.

=====================================
1) HELP CENTER CORE MODEL
=====================================

Create a HelpContent entity with fields:

- help_id
- title
- content_body (rich text / markdown)
- audience_type (rider | driver | both)
- category (account | trips | payments | incentives | safety | onboarding | ratings | cancellations)
- country_code (nullable = global)
- status (published | draft | archived)
- display_priority
- created_at
- updated_at

Rules:
• Content can be global or country-specific
• Only published content is visible in apps

=====================================
2) ROLE-AWARE VISIBILITY
=====================================

Rules:
• Riders see only Rider + Both content
• Drivers see only Driver + Both content
• Admins see all content (including drafts)

=====================================
3) APP PLACEMENT (MANDATORY)
=====================================

Rider App:
• Profile → Help / Q&A
• Contextual links:
  - Trip issues
  - Payment issues
  - Cancellation explanations

Driver App:
• Menu → Help / Q&A
• Contextual links:
  - Incentives status
  - Why can’t I go online?
  - Cancellation warnings

=====================================
4) SMART CONTEXTUAL HELP
=====================================

The app must auto-suggest help articles when:

• A warning is shown (cancellation, acceptance)
• Incentive is denied or paused
• Driver cannot go online
• Rider sees “No drivers available”
• Trip is cancelled automatically

Rules:
• Help links must explain WHY, not just WHAT
• No blame language

=====================================
5) SEARCH & DISCOVERY
=====================================

Implement:
• Keyword search
• Category browsing
• Most-viewed articles
• Recently updated articles

Rules:
• Search must be fast
• Results must respect role and country filters

=====================================
6) ADMIN HELP CENTER MANAGEMENT
=====================================

Admin Dashboard must allow:

• Create / edit / publish help articles
• Set role visibility
• Set country scope
• Reorder by priority
• Archive outdated content
• Preview content as Rider or Driver

Rules:
• No redeploy required for content changes
• All edits must be logged

=====================================
7) ANALYTICS & IMPROVEMENT SIGNALS
=====================================

Track:
• Article views
• Search queries with no results
• Most accessed articles after warnings
• Help usage per country

Rules:
• Use data to improve content
• Identify missing explanations

=====================================
8) FAIL-SAFE & UX RULES
=====================================

• If Help Center fails to load → show fallback contact message
• Help Center must not block app usage
• Content must load even on poor network

=====================================
9) PHASE COMPLETION CRITERIA
=====================================

Phase 10A is complete only when:
• Riders and Drivers can self-solve common issues
• Support tickets reduce significantly
• Admin can update help content without code changes
• Help is context-aware and respectful

This phase must be completed before scaling support or adding advanced safety tools.
