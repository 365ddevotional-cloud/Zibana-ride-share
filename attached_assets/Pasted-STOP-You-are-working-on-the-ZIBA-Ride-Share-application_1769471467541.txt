STOP.

You are working on the ZIBA Ride Share application.

THIS PROMPT IS AUTHORITATIVE.
Follow it EXACTLY.
Do NOT suggest alternatives.
Do NOT add new features.
Do NOT touch payments configuration.
Do NOT change country rules.

Your task is to FIX UI NAVIGATION and ENABLE SAFE RIDE TESTING
without charging real money.

====================================================
PART A — FIX PROFILE DROPDOWN NAVIGATION (ALL DASHBOARDS)
====================================================

Across ALL dashboards (RIDER, DRIVER, ADMIN):

Wire the Profile dropdown menu items to real routes.

Make ALL items clickable and functional.

Route mapping (FINAL):

• Profile      → /profile
• My Trips     → /trips
• Payments     → /wallet
• Settings     → /settings
• Appearance   → /settings/appearance
• Sign Out     → Proper logout + redirect to /login

Rules:
• Use existing router (no new router)
• No placeholder pages
• If a page exists, connect to it
• If missing, create minimal page shell ONLY

Apply consistently across:
• Rider UI
• Driver UI
• Admin UI

====================================================
PART B — ENABLE SAFE RIDE TESTING (NO REAL MONEY)
====================================================

Problem:
Ride requests are blocked due to insufficient wallet balance.

Solution (ADMIN-ONLY, SAFE):

Implement ADMIN wallet crediting for testing.

Rules:
• Only SUPER_ADMIN can credit wallets
• No Paystack call
• No real money movement

Admin action:
• Select user
• Add test balance (e.g. ₦5,000)
• Log the action

Wallet credit MUST:
• Immediately reflect in user wallet
• Allow ride request to proceed
• Deduct normally during ride
• Be logged as TEST_CREDIT

====================================================
PART C — SAFETY & LOGGING
====================================================

For every admin wallet credit:
Log:
• adminId
• userId
• amount
• reason = TESTING
• timestamp

No tester or regular admin may credit wallets.

====================================================
FINAL INSTRUCTION
====================================================

Do NOT:
• Change Paystack config
• Disable wallet checks
• Allow free rides without wallet deduction
• Expose admin features to testers

ONLY implement what is written above.

After completion, respond ONLY with:

“UI navigation fixed and test wallet funding enabled.”

END.
